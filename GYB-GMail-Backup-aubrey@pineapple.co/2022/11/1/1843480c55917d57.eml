Hey Aubrey, thanks for your email.

I absolutely agree that you have taken on more work, the quality of the
work has been strong, you've learned quickly, maintained a great attitude,
communicated well, have learned a lot about the business and I would
estimate you have a strong future no matter what you choose to do.

Your list of additional responsibilities also looks comprehensive and
substantial.

A few notes:

   - For average salaries posted on Glassdoor, these salaries are
   self-reported and it's difficult to get an accurate picture from this.
   Amber uses Salary.com which has slightly different salaries.
   - Amber also found there is a Data Analyst I, II and III. Pay ranges for
   reach and the title usually depends on years of experience.
   - Since we're a remote company we cannot pay everyone based on their
   location


While the definition of a "data analyst" seems to change from company to
company, I assume it does have an analytical component, hence the title.

Amber pulled a job description of a "Data Analyst I" for you here
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9KQiZP1DGkOgrDMXczS4qYKLSEKrPmQkQ3UDuCVc54/edit>.
Do you want to take a look and make sure this matches your current
responsibilities so we can discuss?

I also searched google for a quick description of a data analyst and found
this:

*Data analysts are responsible for analyzing data using statistical
techniques, implementing and maintaining databases, gathering data from
primary and secondary sources, identifying, analyzing and interpreting
trends from the data*


Based on that definition, I would agree you are "gathering data from
primary and secondary sources" but I'm not so sure about the other facets
of the role.

What are your thoughts?

If you do agree, then perhaps we can lay out a plan to get you those
additional skills so you can reach your career and salary goals.

These skills would include:

   - Analyzing data using statistical techniques
   - Knowledge of and practicing use of statistical technicales
   - Knowledge about databases
   - Education on analyzing data and reporting on trends/findings

Learning how the new data engineer, Jean-Francios Hardy (JFH), is setting
up our databases and why, would go a long way to improving database
knowledge - along with asking him plenty of questions.

We will be having weekly checkin calls with JFH Fridays at 11:30am ET, so
I'd love for you to join those starting this week with the first call.

In addition, you can work with the COO of my friend's company (very similar
to ours) to learn how they use this data system so you can manipulate the
data, build reports and issue requests to the engineer for any additional
support you may need. The system won't be ready until late December, but
when it is ready we will need someone in that role composing the reports.

I can also give you the responsibility of analyzing and reporting on this
data once these reports are functional and Dimitri can give you the
responsibility of analyzing MID health and fraud reports with his oversight.

In the meantime, I think boosting your knowledge/skills with Knime so we
can build / re-build key reports and double check them with a trustworthy
consultant is key.

We also have reports we want to update/refresh for 2023, which is important.

I believe a timeline of roughly 6-8 months is needed to build these skills
up - hopefully closer to 6 months because I know you're a fairly quick
learner.

The only other concern I have here is that I did, at some point, intend to
hire an experienced data/business analyst with 3+ years of ecommerce
experience who could bring best data practices to our company from another
successful company.

I'm not sure if these plans could play out if you also want to be the data
analyst at the company and it could take too much time and be too much of a
risk to try to train you from the ground up, especially in an area where
I'm not an expert.

I have not made a firm decision here one way or another yet, but it's
something that's on my mind and I want to share with you.

The other disadvantage here is that if you are the data analyst, then there
may not be room/money for another more skilled data person to come in from
whom you could learn from, which could potentially impact your career path
and growth.

These are all things worth considering and while I think you certainly
deserve a raise, most of these questions revolve around your career goals
vs the company needs and I think that needs to be discussed and agreed upon
first.

*Do you have time to chat either tomorrow 2:30pm or Thursday 2-3pm ET about
this?*
