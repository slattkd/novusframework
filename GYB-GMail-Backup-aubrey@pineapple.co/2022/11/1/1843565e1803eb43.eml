Hi Brett,

I've looked at the job description for Data Analyst I that you attached and
I feel that it matches my current responsibilities.  Moreover, I have done
this work largely *without* the managerial oversight the job
description describes for this position; so while I may not be at the
Analyst II level, I have worked in that capacity regarding the independence
with which I've operated.

Frankly, I'm rather bewildered that you say that I only "gather data from
primary and secondary sources," as I feel that most of what I do involves
further analyzing and organizing this data using various statistical
tools.  Not only have I upheld continuity for key reports, I've also
created new reports that measure specific metrics for various departments,
including finding profit & margins, rates of return, etc.-- which are all
KPIs that help provide insight for decision-making, or evaluating success,
within the company.  I have employed KNIME, SQL, data warehouses, Excel,
Google workbooks, to make sense of and present this information in a clear
and concise way.  If these are not examples of analyzing data using
statistical techniques and reporting on trends, I'm not sure what is.

While I recognize that I still have a lot to learn, I've spent at least the
past 6 months proving that I can not only hold down this department by
myself in terms of continuing reporting in the way that it has been done,
but also continue to take on new challenges with the skills that I have
honed in this position.  For example, I may not have formal education
around databases, but I had been using Greg's SQL database successfully
since his departure in April.

I do understand your concern regarding the company's need to potentially
hire a more experienced Data Analyst, and I would certainly like to have an
opportunity to learn directly from someone in this role.

However, my main point in asking for this raise is that I would like my pay
to reflect the amount and type of work I do and have taken on at this
company.  If I'm going to be expected to perform the duties of a Data
Analyst, then I would like to be paid as such.  I don't think that the
amount of time that I've been in the position, nor the possibility of a
future manager, actually changes the reality of the work that I do for this
company at this point in time.

*I'd be happy to discuss this further with you tomorrow at 2:30 pm ET.*

Thanks,
Aubrey
