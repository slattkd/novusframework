Hi Brett,

For the reports you listed you want me to build out:

   - Do the Weekly sales report & the Affiliate report need to be changed
   in some way, or are you saying that they are just the highest priority to
   keep up with as they are now?
   - I'm working on ALTV and have ALTVs/ALTPs for Jan-September 2022.  I am
   still working on the historical reporting between 6/2021 and now so that we
   can track how it's fluctuated over time/help verify the current ALTVs
   - I will make sure to get with Dimitri so we can discuss Fraud Analysis
   & Merchant Health reporting further, knowing that those reports are of the
   utmost importance

In regards to your questions:

   1. I would most appreciate having a second set of eyes to go through the
   workflows to ensure that the logic is correct, etc.  Like I said, I'm using
   Ian's workflow but updated to accommodate changes in the company since his
   departure, but would appreciate having another person to help verify my
   findings.  If a consultant is the best option for that, then that would be
   great.
   2. I have not finished the courses.  I'm about half-way through, but
   only had about a week to focus on the courses before other priorities took
   precedent.  I've been spending more of my time building the Q4 dashboard,
   working on ALTV, and ad hoc reporting for Avalara, in addition to keeping
   up with my standard reports.
   3. I now have a second computer available to run KNIME routines on,
   should that be something that I need to do in the future.


Thanks,
Aubrey
