Hi Marco,

I'm working on getting this Q4 Dashboard together for Brett, and I had a
question regarding your Email sales.

I know you said that SMS is under AFFID 2453, so I have that covered.  I
also remember that you said it would be difficult to get the Email data on
Mondays as it's not in Sticky.  My question is this:

The other AFFIDs that you manage (1331, 2051, 1928, etc) whose sales are
recorded on the Weekly Sales Dashboard are *not* the email sales Brett
wants to track for the Q4 dashboard?
I'm just a bit confused because Greg had categorized those AFFIDs as
Internal Marketing from "Email Dept", either Front-End Newsletters or
Back-End Auto-responders.

If those *are* what Brett is looking for, then I shouldn't have any issue
reporting on that using the workflow for the Weekly Sales Dashboard.  Just
thought I'd check in case it saved some time.

Thanks,
Aubrey
