Hi Brett,

I can certainly start working on getting a report like this together.  It
seems like some of the data you're requesting is straightforward, or can be
pulled from the weekly sales dashboard, but there will be additional
information I'll have to work on getting.  For example, DJ's Amazon sales
are not in Sticky, so I'll have to get a weekly report from him or Emily in
order to chart that.  I only have access to their monthly transaction
reports currently, so it's something I'll have to look further into to
ensure I can complete this in a timely fashion each week.

Additionally, I'll need more information on how I am to divide sales by
individuals.  Like, specifically which accounts are Jack's PPC's?  What
would CS, under Brooke, be tracking?  Perhaps we could meet tomorrow, or
discuss further in our weekly meeting, so that I can make sure I'm fully
understanding what you're looking for in each category.

Thanks,
Aubrey
