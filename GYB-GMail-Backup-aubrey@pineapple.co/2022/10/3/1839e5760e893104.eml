Yeah I believe DJ has an assistant in his department, so I would task the
assistant with gathering all the sales of all the SKUS and then we use some
kind of formula to factor in COGs and Amazon fees to get a profit number.

All PPC is Jack.

I think the only sales Brooke's team makes are under "Phone Sales"
actually, so you already have that, though I don't think you're factoring
in the commissions paid to sales people right now as acquisition costs, are
you? If not, we definitely should be doing that on the weekly sales dash.
