Hey Aubrey, thanks again for sharing your thoughts on our call today.

It appears you're a little stressed or confused and I was not nearly as
patient and understanding about things as I should have been on the call,
especially given Jarren's departure.

I think a lot of the confusion stems from you being hired by someone else
and not being given a clear job description or mission statement... I also
assume there was no proper onboarding (e.g. 90 day plan).

You were hired at a time in the company when we were growing quickly,
hiring a lot of people and - since this is my first company - onboarding
was not as tight as it should have been.

I think the best thing to do is to try to get on the same page about
role/responsibility and your goals for your career so we can all agree on
that and be on the same page going forward.

*1. If you could create a Google Doc that has the following:*
- Your title
- Your 1-2 sentence responsibility(s)
- A bulleted list of all your major responsibilities
- A separate bulleted list of your career goals

Then we can review this together.

2. Second, if I remember correctly on the call, you also say you were
confused about what needed to be done and that things change (or there is
something new) every week.

I want to make sure we address that so there is less confusion.

I propose making a list of priorities of what you're working on and we can
review that weekly.

If you want, you can send me your list today and I will review.

3. Lastly, you expressed some concerns about where the department is headed
and what your role in the department will be.

I took some time to think about that just now - since the data team
situation is still evolving with Jarren's departure.

Originally, the plan was to have an engineer, analyst and assistant to the
analyst.

That still sounds like the plan to me.

Realistically, it may take some time to make those hires.

I want to make sure we get the hires right, as it's been a tough learning
experience for me trying to bring in the right people.

But I do want you to keep in mind that we will always have a lot of
excel-powered reports and may continue to use Knime for some purposes.

People have recommended to me to build the reports in Excel first to get
them right and then build them in Tableau because it takes longer and it's
harder to make changes.

Excel will also allow us to move faster.

If we say: hey, I wonder what it would look like if we had this data or
that data... then a report in Excel or Google Sheets would help a lot.

It's also possible we link Google Sheets with a Google Big Query Database
and can pull data into the sheets that way.

Bottom line: I think we will always want both spreadsheet powered reports
and BI tool powered reports.

Hope this alleviates some of your concerns.

Can you let me know if there are additional concerns you think I did not
address here?
