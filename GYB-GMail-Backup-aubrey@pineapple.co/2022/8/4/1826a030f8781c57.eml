Hi Aubrey,

Thank you for your help this morning. Call went well with Colin. He wanted
two things represented in the report and then we should be ready.

He wants to see Units per type to better skew the data. For example - it
now says Banner Ads took 9 hours which on paper looks ridiculous. However,
if it said 5 banner ads took 9 hours, that is more realistic. I am going
through each line item on the Project Stats tab to ensure I am
providing you with the units.

Secondly, are we able to put text boxes next to charts? He wants us to
capture any discrepancies so that anyone reading the report understands the
full information. As I was saying to you earlier, John has more tasks than
are being shown and we want to capture that.

Let me know what you think and if you need anything else from me.

 I hope I was not creating any confusion with the types. I went through and=
 adjusted them. The VSL is a type but since it is worked on as a project by=
 itself (we are not tracking it here) you can leave it off your data sheet.=
