Hi Aubrey,

Thank you so much for doing this. I did have a few questions/comments;

- I noticed the total sum of the days that the projects were running was
over 1000. Is it pertinent to add them up because that is more days than 3
years lol. Help me if I am missing the purpose please.
- Please remove Sean (swore I took him off earlier) as he is not a writer.
I also amended the project he worked on with Kim to just reflect her as I
was only counting her hours.

I shared it with Colin to see if he is ok with it. Once he approves and you
make the changes above, I can share with Brett.

Thanks again!!
