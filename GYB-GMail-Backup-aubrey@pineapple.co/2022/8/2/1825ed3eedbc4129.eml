Hi Shawna,

All of your changes have been reflected in the Copy Writers' Report
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qMD8hs1eNX3BR6Y7dEaLVcSu-7-Rr4FDy65quEkMJ68/edit?usp=sharing>,
so it should now be complete for July.

Let me know if you notice any issues or need further assistance!  Otherwise
we'll plan to do this again next month! :)

Thanks!
Aubrey
