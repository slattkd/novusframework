Hey Brett,

One of the main items I've been waiting on  is an accounting of the
incoming sales, revenue collected, affiliate revenue
collected, affiliate reports, and what was paid out, across the board
specific to GothamClub.

I think Sean was going to provide, or Gene was going to, but didn't receive
it yet.
So not sure what has flown through May to July.

Fran's accounting was a subset of this.
I see in May there was $1300 in sales for them.
Of the 1300, I assume Gotham charges $69.95 and we pay the affiliates
$1300, so automatically at a loss. I don't know how prior months are then
taken into consideration, or we start with a negative balance basically.
Also, what are the other costs and revenue points.
Is there X amount deducted for the affiliate manager that helped drive
that, or the accounting that does the calculations and payouts?
What was the % factor or $$$ amount. So this doesn't change too much.
Were there other costs that happened that we should be aware of?

We paid $4,700, so obviously overpaid or paid the 5G portion of it?

Kind Regards,

Mark Bauman

>>>>>>>>> Hi Mark,
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> I apologize for the delay in responding to you, I wanted to make
>>>>>>>>> sure I had all of the appropriate documentation to provide you before
>>>>>>>>> reaching out.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> We currently employ a KNIME workflow to calculate revenue, apply
>>>>>>>>> expenses, and determine profit share (
>>>>>>>>> https://www.knime.com/downloads/download-knime).  Every time we
>>>>>>>>> run the routine, we use exports from Sticky & CAKE that go back for the
>>>>>>>>> lifetime of our agreement with Fran (May 2020 for the non-Info funnels;
>>>>>>>>> Info products themselves were introduced in October 2020).  The reason for
>>>>>>>>> this is twofold: 1. To capture any refunds, chargebacks, voids that have
>>>>>>>>> happened, as they can occur well after the date of sale. 2. In light of
>>>>>>>>> those possible fluctuations in profit, every month the routine reevaluates
>>>>>>>>> *total* profit and compares the *total *owed to Enrich to what
>>>>>>>>> we've already paid out in the past in order to determine current profit
>>>>>>>>> share.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> I've attached all the necessary exports in order to run the
>>>>>>>>> routine.  I've only attached the files to run the routine for July, since
>>>>>>>>> the workflow compounds on itself each month.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Here is a brief rundown of how the workflow functions:
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>    - Declined & Test orders are removed from exports;  Sticky
>>>>>>>>>    "Order ID" is connected to CAKE "Transaction ID"
>>>>>>>>>    - Gross Revenue is the sum of the "Order Total" column from
>>>>>>>>>    Sticky
>>>>>>>>>    - Chargebacks, Refunds, and Voids are flagged and totaled,
>>>>>>>>>    respectively; then, all are subtracted from the Gross Revenue.
>>>>>>>>>    - Next, expenses are applied.  Info
>>>>>>>>>    Products specifically don't incur COGS (raw material), Shipping, or
>>>>>>>>>    Packaging costs, but they do incur the following expenses:
>>>>>>>>>    - Processing Fees: MID credit card/transaction fees,
>>>>>>>>>    determined by Gateway processing & transaction rates
>>>>>>>>>    - Marketing Fees: Includes Phone Sales commissions, if
>>>>>>>>>    applicable, determined by AFFID and each agent's rate
>>>>>>>>>    - Affiliate Fees: Affiliate Manager Payout, if applicable;
>>>>>>>>>    Affiliate Payout Loss is the sum of the "Paid" column from CAKE
>>>>>>>>>    - Cost Adjustment Share: Part of an agreement reached in
>>>>>>>>>    2/2022; Determined by category, Gotham Share is 50%
>>>>>>>>>    - Net Profit = Gross Revenue - (Chargebacks, Refunds, Voids) -
>>>>>>>>>    (Expenses) + 50% Cost Adjustment Share
>>>>>>>>>    - Lastly, all previous payments are totaled and subtracted
>>>>>>>>>    from total net profit, for each respective funnel to determine the current
>>>>>>>>>    payout
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> The "Full Cost Breakdown" document is the deliverable from the
>>>>>>>>> KNIME workflow that provides the profit calculation/payout information I've
>>>>>>>>> described above.  I've attached the completed Cost Breakdown from 5-1-2020
>>>>>>>>> to 7-31-2022, which gives you all of the information you're looking for,
>>>>>>>>> for the lifetime of the deal.  Obviously you can disregard the other Enrich
>>>>>>>>> funnels.  This is one of several documents you should get when you run the
>>>>>>>>> routine, if you choose to.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to meet
>>>>>>>>> to discuss further.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Thank you!

v>Hi Mark,<div><br></div><div>I apologize for the delay in responding to yo=
u, I wanted to make sure I had all of the appropriate documentation to prov=
ide you before reaching out.</div><div><br></div><div>We currently employ a=
 KNIME workflow to calculate revenue, apply expenses, and determine profit =
share (<a href=3D"https://www.knime.com/downloads/download-knime" target=3D=
"_blank">https://www.knime.com/downloads/download-knime</a>).=C2=A0 Every t=
ime we run the routine, we use exports from Sticky &amp; CAKE that go back =
for the lifetime of our agreement with Fran (May 2020 for the non-Info funn=
els; Info products themselves were introduced in October 2020).=C2=A0 The r=
eason for this is twofold: 1. To capture any refunds, chargebacks, voids th=
at have happened, as they can occur well after the date of sale. 2. In ligh=
t of those possible fluctuations in profit, every month the routine reevalu=
ates <i>total</i> profit and compares the <i>total </i>owed to Enrich to wh=
at we&#39;ve already paid out in the past in order to determine current pro=
fit share.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve attached all the necessary exp=
orts in order to run the routine.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve only attached the files to=
 run the routine for July, since the workflow compounds on itself each mont=
h.=C2=A0=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a brief rundown of how the =
workflow functions:</div><div><ul><li>Declined &amp; Test orders are remove=
d from exports;=C2=A0

Sticky &quot;Order ID&quot; is connected to CAKE &quot;Transaction ID&quot;=
</li><li>Gross Revenue is the sum of the &quot;Order Total&quot; column fro=
m Sticky</li><li>Chargebacks, Refunds, and Voids are flagged and totaled, r=
espectively; then, all are subtracted from the Gross Revenue.</li><li>Next,=
 expenses are applied.=C2=A0 Info Products=C2=A0specifically=C2=A0don&#39;t=
 incur COGS (raw material), Shipping, or Packaging costs, but they do incur=
 the following expenses:</li><li>Processing Fees: MID credit card/transacti=
on fees, determined by Gateway processing &amp; transaction rates</li><li>M=
arketing Fees: Includes Phone Sales commissions, if applicable, determined =
by AFFID and each agent&#39;s rate</li><li>Affiliate Fees: Affiliate Manage=
r Payout, if applicable; Affiliate Payout Loss is the sum of the &quot;Paid=
&quot; column from CAKE=C2=A0</li><li>Cost Adjustment Share: Part of an agr=
eement reached in 2/2022; Determined by category, Gotham Share is 50%</li><=
li>Net Profit =3D Gross Revenue - (Chargebacks, Refunds, Voids) - (Expenses=
)=C2=A0+ 50% Cost Adjustment Share</li><li>Lastly, all previous payments ar=
e totaled and subtracted from total net profit, for each respective funnel =
to determine the current payout</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The &quot;Full=
 Cost Breakdown&quot; document is the deliverable from the KNIME workflow t=
hat provides the profit calculation/payout information I&#39;ve described a=
bove.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve attached the completed Cost Breakdown from 5-1-2020 to=
 7-31-2022, which gives you all of the information you&#39;re looking for, =
for the lifetime of the deal.=C2=A0 Obviously you can disregard the other E=
nrich funnels.=C2=A0 This is one of several documents you should get when y=
ou run the routine, if you choose to.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div>Pl=
ease let me know if you have any questions or would like to meet to discuss=
 further.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you!</div><div>Aubrey</div><div><b=
