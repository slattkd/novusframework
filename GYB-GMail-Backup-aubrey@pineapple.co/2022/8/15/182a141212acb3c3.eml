Thanks, Carlos!  Having a wonderful time so far!

For the report, I feel confident in the Revenue, as well as the
Chargebacks/Voids/Refunds, so the top section is essentially complete.

Where it needs more work is in nailing down some of the expenses.  The main
goal is to find sources for these expenses outside of the Finance
department, but I'm having trouble locating some of them outside of monthly
P&L's/Quickbooks.  Also, it sounds like P&Ls are incomplete for prior
months, which makes things harder.

The top half of the expenses are the ones I'm more confident about.  The
bottom half (in gray) are expenses that I've only found through the Finance.
What I'm currently still looking for (either from the P&L or other sources):
-Payroll: Andrea said this may fluctuate from month to month.
-Contractors: This includes people like Gene & Doug Smith, among some
others.  I can calculate Doug Smith's commission but I was unable to
confirm all of these folks' base pay rates.
-SAAS Subscriptions: Again, Finance said this can fluctuate.  Not sure
where else I would get this info from right now.
-Merchant Fees: aka Credit Card Processing Fees.  The KNIME routine has a
way to calculate this but it needs to be updated to reflect any changes in
rates and the addition of any new MIDs.
-G&A expenses: Again, this can fluctuate.  It's a relatively small number
but not sure where else to find it.
-Chargeback Fees: Finance lumps the fees we incur and payments we make with
the actual $ we have to refund for the CB.  Finance confirmed these charges
come from Midigator and Chargeback Hero, so it will just be a matter of
finding it directly from there, and then I've been subtracting CBs from
Sticky from that value.
-Email List: This seems consistent but I need more P&Ls to be sure.

I'm going to reach out to Dimitri regarding CBs, as Brett said he may be
able to help there.

Otherwise, I believe I have enumerated all of our expenses to find profit.
Does that seem accurate to you?

Thank you!
Aubrey
