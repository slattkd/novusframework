Yeah this is what I'm doing.  Currently re-running the report for May -
July, but technically speaking the report was accurate through 4/30/2022,
now that we know that those upsells were indeed supposed to be attributed
to Fran.


It's confusing though because I'm not sure what attachment they're
referring to, but it sounds like Andrea is talking about the Gross Revenue
sheet, which does not represent the profit the 41.5% would be taken from.
