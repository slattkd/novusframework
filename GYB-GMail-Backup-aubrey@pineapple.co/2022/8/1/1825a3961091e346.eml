Hey Aubrey

I was out last week on vacation when this email was sent out. I have a few
reports that I am looking for...

Print Reports
-5G Male Profit and Revenue
-FS Profit and Revenue
-ND Profit and Revenue (Creative being worked on)
-5G Male Print (Creative being worked on)

1. What is the goal of this report?
Measure our Profit and Revenue for each creative.
2. What will be the frequency of this report? (e.g. daily, monthly,
quarterly)
A weekly report
3. Why is this report critical?
To understand how long it takes each mailing to become profitable, how long
does a mailing last, and the long-term revenue and profit of each mailing
4. If you have multiple requests, please indicate which report is of the
highest priority and why.
The print reports would be a higher priority vs the sales team reports. 5G
and FS are currently live, those should be the focus.
5. Is this report being done by your or your team but takes up a lot of
time, or could be done better using automation?
I can run a revenue report, but it takes too long and I am unable to
provide an accurate profit calculation

Sales Team reports
-Break down by day of sales by agent
-Autoship report
-Product Report
1. What is the goal of this report?
A more detailed sales report from the agents broken down by day
A percentage based report to understand rebills for the sales team
Product by agent reports can help use see who is selling what and when

2. What will be the frequency of this report? (e.g. daily, monthly,
quarterly)
A weekly report
3. Why is this report critical?
These will help us understand gaps and identify any improvements we can
make as a team to increase overall revenue
4. If you have multiple requests, please indicate which report is of the
highest priority and why.
The phone reports are secondary compared the print reports
5. Is this report being done by your or your team but takes up a lot of
time, or could be done better using automation?
I can utilize the reports I already have, but they don't provide an
accurate breakdown of products or autoship.

I would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss the above as it is a
lot of reports, I believe we have some of these already, but I do not have
access to them.

Let me know what time and day works best for you

Thanks
