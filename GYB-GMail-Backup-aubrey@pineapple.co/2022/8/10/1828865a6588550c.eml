Hi Brooke,

You are correct that we use their AFFIDs to track phone sales and find
their commission.

I was on a call with Robert yesterday and he brought up this issue as
well.  He and I both double-checked my weekly Phone Sales Commission report
from Monday and found the same results, so it would appear that their sales
and commission were captured properly.

I confirmed my findings by getting a new Sticky export for the
week (yesterday after the issue had been resolved), and manually checking
their commission against their overall sales.  I believe Robert then
cross-referenced my findings against the sales agents' own records of their
sales.  I've cc'ed him here so that he can confirm.

Happy to take another look if we have concerns this still may be incorrect!
Thanks!
Aubrey
