=C2=A0the company and help us navigate the economic downturn, I&#39;d like =
to find a way to evaluate where the company is at on the 1st of the month a=
nd the 15th.<div><br></div><div><b>The issue is:=C2=A0</b>the finance depar=
tment does something called a &quot;close&quot; in which they need about tw=
o weeks to get all the financial data in order and ensure its accurate befo=
re presenting it to me.</div><div><br></div><div>And so the data I&#39;m ge=
tting is DANGEROUSLY delayed.</div><div><br></div><div>Solutions:</div><div=
><br></div><div>1) So obviously you can keep getting me the sales per month=
 on the first of every month. But I&#39;d also recommend you get me that da=
ta on the 15th as well.<br></div><div><br></div><div>2) The data will be mo=
re useful if we can get as many of our expenses into those reports as soon =
as possible.=C2=A0</div><div>- We can get refunds, chargebacks from Sticky<=
/div><div>- We can get acquisition costs from the advertising platforms</di=
v><div>- Employee expenses should be fairly predictable and repetitive (can=
 get data from finance)</div><div>- The rest of the expenses are paid every=
 Monday, so finance should be able to provide that</div><div>- The last thi=
ng is credit cards, if we pay those 2x weekly, then you should be able to g=
et the totals of those payments weekly</div><div>- There might be other exp=
enses? I would confirm w Andrea</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly we can comp=
are your preliminary report w Andrea&#39;s &quot;close&quot; report and see=
 how off they are and why.</div><div><br></div><div>But ultimately I&#39;d =
want to get it within about 5% of difference for the preliminary.</div><div=
><br></div><div>Preliminary will be slightly less accurate and MUCH faster.=
</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Close&quot; report will be highly accuratel=
y, very slow.</div><div><br></div><div>Does this make sense?<br></div></div=
