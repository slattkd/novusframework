>Hey Aubrey, to improve=C2=A0the company and help us navigate the economic =
downturn, I&#39;d like to find a way to evaluate where the company is at on=
 the 1st of the month and the 15th.<div><br></div><div><b>The issue is:=C2=
=A0</b>the finance department does something called a &quot;close&quot; in =
which they need about two weeks to get all the financial data in order and =
ensure its accurate before presenting it to me.</div><div><br></div><div>An=
d so the data I&#39;m getting is DANGEROUSLY delayed.</div><div><br></div><=
div>Solutions:</div><div><br></div><div>1) So obviously you can keep gettin=
g me the sales per month on the first of every month. But I&#39;d also reco=
mmend you get me that data on the 15th as well.<br></div><div><br></div><di=
v>2) The data will be more useful if we can get as many of our expenses int=
o those reports as soon as possible.=C2=A0</div><div>- We can get refunds, =
chargebacks from Sticky</div><div>- We can get acquisition costs from the a=
dvertising platforms</div><div>- Employee expenses should be fairly predict=
able and repetitive (can get data from finance)</div><div>- The rest of the=
 expenses are paid every Monday, so finance should be able to provide that<=
/div><div>- The last thing is credit cards, if we pay those 2x weekly, then=
 you should be able to get the totals of those payments weekly</div><div>- =
There might be other expenses? I would confirm w Andrea</div><div><br></div=
><div>Lastly we can compare your preliminary report w Andrea&#39;s &quot;cl=
ose&quot; report and see how off they are and why.</div><div><br></div><div=
>But ultimately I&#39;d want to get it within about 5% of difference for th=
e preliminary.</div><div><br></div><div>Preliminary will be slightly less a=
ccurate and MUCH faster.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Close&quot; report =
will be highly accurately, very slow.</div><div><br></div><div>Does this ma=
ke sense?<br></div></div></div></div></div><div><br></div></div></div>
