Good morning Bob,

I did not personally receive an invoice from Mark for June's revenue
share.  It should be directed to Andrea Abramowski (andrea@pineapple.co),
as she is in our Finance department and remits these payments.  Andrea
should be able to confirm whether that has been paid (or received), or not.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance!

Thank you!
Aubrey

</div>
<div>
<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Bob,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thank you so much for your patience while I worked through this.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I&#39;ve attached a revised report with corrected Gross Revenue number=
s for our Enrich Products through June of 2022.=C2=A0 =C2=A0For ease of com=
parison, I have also included the February 2022 report that you referenced =
in your previous email to Brett.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In a nutshell, the issue we were having with this report stemmed from =
the KNIME routine we use to calculate these sales numbers.=C2=A0 We recentl=
y did an overhaul of our Products and the naming conventions we use for the=
ir=C2=A0Categories in Sticky.=C2=A0 These changes
 revealed the miscategorization of some of our Enrich Products, so those sa=
les were not being properly captured by our routine.=C2=A0 The re-categoriz=
ation was being done during the month of May, which is why this issue cropp=
ed up at that time.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The issue that we were having with miscategorized=C2=A0products was tw=
o-fold:</div>
<div>1. In the most recent reports that you were sent, we were missing an E=
nrich product in the Info Products Funnel.=C2=A0 This is why the Gross Reve=
nue numbers were so much lower than the report you received in months prior=
.=C2=A0
<b>That has been corrected, and you will see that the Gross Revenue for the=
 Info Products Funnel has been restored to its previous values.=C2=A0</b></=
div>
<div>2. Upon doing further research to ensure products were being properly =
categorized, I discovered that there were times in the past that non-Enrich=
 Supernatural Man products were being erroneously included in the Enrich Mo=
ntezuma funnel.<b>=C2=A0 This means that
 the corrected Gross Revenue values that I&#39;ve sent you are indeed lower=
 for that funnel than they were in our end-of-February report.</b>=C2=A0 Ou=
r Product re-categorization project had actually fixed this issue before I =
was able to recognize it as such.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Additionally, you will notice a new funnel for Enrich Genetic Peak, wh=
ich is a new Enrich product that had not been incorporated into the KNIME r=
outine previously.</div>
<div><b><br>
</b></div>
<div>I sincerely apologize for the confusion that this has caused.=C2=A0 I =
am still working on ensuring that the routine is properly calculating Profi=
t and therefore our monthly Enrich Payout.=C2=A0 My goals are to: 1. See ex=
actly where we may have overpaid in the past,
 and 2. Ensure that the underestimated calculations from the past couple mo=
nths are corrected and paid out accordingly.=C2=A0 I am hoping to have this=
 resolved in the next week.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or =
need any further explanation.=C2=A0
