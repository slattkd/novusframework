Hi Aubrey,

Thanks for all the time you've spent reviewing the numbers and adjusting to
ensure the correct payments are being processed. From what I can tell it
was no small task.

Fran has asked me to get a bit in the weeds here and make sure we're all on
the same page, particularly in reference to the funnel revenue
calculations. Is there a time in the next 2 days we could chat for a few
minutes? I'm fairly open on my meeting schedule so I'll be happy to adjust
to your schedule.

Cheers,
Joel K.

Subject: Re: Enrich Marketing Reported Sales

Hi Bob,

Thank you so much for your patience while I worked through this.

I've attached a revised report with corrected Gross Revenue numbers for our
Enrich Products through June of 2022.   For ease of comparison, I have also
included the February 2022 report that you referenced in your previous
email to Brett.

In a nutshell, the issue we were having with this report stemmed from the
KNIME routine we use to calculate these sales numbers.  We recently did an
overhaul of our Products and the naming conventions we use for their
Categories in Sticky.  These changes revealed the miscategorization of some
of our Enrich Products, so those sales were not being properly captured by
our routine.  The re-categorization was being done during the month of May,
which is why this issue cropped up at that time.

The issue that we were having with miscategorized products was two-fold:
1. In the most recent reports that you were sent, we were missing an Enrich
product in the Info Products Funnel.  This is why the Gross Revenue numbers
were so much lower than the report you received in months prior.  That has
been corrected, and you will see that the Gross Revenue for the Info
Products Funnel has been restored to its previous values.
2. Upon doing further research to ensure products were being properly
categorized, I discovered that there were times in the past that non-Enrich
Supernatural Man products were being erroneously included in the Enrich
Montezuma funnel.  This means that the corrected Gross Revenue values that
I've sent you are indeed lower for that funnel than they were in our
end-of-February report.  Our Product re-categorization project had actually
fixed this issue before I was able to recognize it as such.

Additionally, you will notice a new funnel for Enrich Genetic Peak, which
is a new Enrich product that had not been incorporated into the KNIME
routine previously.

I sincerely apologize for the confusion that this has caused.  I am still
working on ensuring that the routine is properly calculating Profit and
therefore our monthly Enrich Payout.  My goals are to: 1. See exactly where
we may have overpaid in the past, and 2. Ensure that the underestimated
calculations from the past couple months are corrected and paid out
accordingly.  I am hoping to have this resolved in the next week.

Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or need any
further explanation.
Thank you,
Aubrey
