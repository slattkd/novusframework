Hi Brett,

Thank you for hearing and understanding my efficiency survey responses!

I think having Ian's insights will definitely help me start getting some
new and valuable reports in action, and I'm hopeful that he will be able to
advise me on some of the issues I've had with the KNIME routines.  I mostly
just want to confirm my understanding of the way things are working and get
that second set of eyes on it.

I feel like making the change away from reporting to Mike and the DevOps
team will at least remove that extra layer of management that sometimes
left me without answers since Mike has so much on his plate and his
experience doesn't really help me with the issues I've been having.  While
it may be too early to tell how I will fair reporting to you directly, it
definitely addresses that issue!

I'm also hopeful that Jarren and I working more closely will help us work
through some of these issues together as we get more of these reports into
Tableau.  Brooke has been an enormous help previously, as her institutional
knowledge of the company and willingness to work through these problems
with me has been unmatched and greatly appreciated.

I will continue to rely on her, you, Jarren, and Ian where I can, and I do
believe that will help greatly.

Thank you!
Aubrey
