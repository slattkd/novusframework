Hi Shawna!

Thanks for your patience on my reply!  Now that I've had some time to dig
into the data you provided me, I think I have most of what I need to create
this report for you.  However, I have a couple questions that will help me
make sure this report is capturing exactly what you'd like it to.

1. How many hours should be assumed for each day of writing?  Or will the
hours eventually be listed as well? I don't see the hours listed on the
Dashboard you sent over, but I could apply them based on a 4 hour average
per day, for example.
2. How can I tell when a project is completed?  I see the "Completed"
column but I was confused by the task with a status that reads "Ready" (Row
9).  Just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly!
3. What do you mean when you say "Dept Efficiency"?  I take that to mean
how much of the Writers' time each department is taking up, but please let
me know if I'm misunderstanding.

I'll be able to get started on the framework of this report while I await
your reply.  I may have some more questions arise as I get further iit, but
it is my goal to have something to share with you by Wednesday of next week
(7/20) so I can get your feedback and make adjustments accordingly.

Hope you have a lovely weekend!
Best,
Aubrey
