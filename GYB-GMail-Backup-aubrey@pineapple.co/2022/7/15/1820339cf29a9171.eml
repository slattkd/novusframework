Brett,

-I did not create/name the Weekly Sales Dashboard so I just left the title
as it was, but it goes from 2021 through the present.  The reason that it
is listed as 2022 on the Reports doc is because when I first started Greg
had me audit the Weekly Sales Dashboard for all of 2022.  I'll change the
name if it is confusing.

-The "Sales & Profit Report w/ Expenses"
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3xvwLAamChCJPwhlFza0OnQBOkKWx-luJ8FZaDI7Do/edit?usp=sharing>
is the new report that you requested from me yesterday.  I hadn't yet
shared the doc with you as I don't have all the expenses in there; I am
reaching out to Andrea so once I am able to get more information from her I
can start to add those in.  Here is Gross & Net revenue for 7/1-7/14
without expenses for now:
7/1-7/14/2022
Gross Revenue $928,474.84
Refunds -$63,397.20
Voids -$27,696.25
Chargebacks -$893.88
Net Revenue $836,487.51

In regards to this reporting I just wanted to clarify whether you want it
on the 15th or if it would be better to include the 15th in the report?  I
ask because this is how I break up the other report that I do every 2 weeks
for Phone Sales Commissions (1-15 for first half of month & 16-30/31 for
second half).

-I have added a new column with approximately how long these reports take
each week.

-The bottom section below the black line has notes that Greg took on what
other reports might be needed.  Unfortunately I do not know anything about
those as they are notes that Greg took himself and not anything he and I
ever got to discuss in detail.  It seems like they were requested by a
specific person or department but I cannot say for sure.

-I report on Dr. Masley & Dr. Feuerstein jointly in a monthly email.  All
that is needed for Dr. Masley specifically is the number of *new *Floraspring
customers; it is my understanding that Brooke then uses this number along
with the # of CS requests/complaints, to get an overall "customer
happiness" percentage (# of new customers/# of complaints).

-The Autoship bonus is for Phone Sales employees and I've also heard it
referred to as Continuity Commission.  It is calculated separately from the
Front-End Phone Sales Commissions.

-The second page has some of Greg's suggestions for best data practices.
You do not need to worry about it.  Many of those suggestions have been
implemented already.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
Thanks,
Aubrey
