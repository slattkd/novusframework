Hi,

So let me try to answer as best as I can. I have cc=E2=80=99d Colin as well=
 so just
in case he has any better answers he can supply those.

We will assume a 4 hour writing work day. The other 4 is to go towards
research.

I will include when they are completed and populate at the end of the week
how many hours they took to write each project. The tab you are reading is
only =E2=80=98Project Stats=E2=80=99 not the entire thing. It is the last t=
ab at the
bottom, you may need to scroll right.

You can feel free to give insight into which department sends most of their
projects but I believe that Brett and Colin mostly want to know
comparatively who is pushing out the most work and how long they take on
average. That way we know how to create a plan for improvements.

I think that=E2=80=99s all your questions. Feel free to ask more when you h=
ave
them.
