Hi Andrea!

I hope you are looking forward to a nice weekend!  I had Brett request a
new report from me, and I could use your help in finding data on some of
our expenses.  I've attached Brett's correspondence below so that you have
some context.  He would like me to be able to have a quicker, though
perhaps slightly less accurate, Sales & Profit report that we could compare
to your monthly "close."

I am able to use Sticky to find Gross Revenue, as well as chargebacks,
voids, refunds, declines, etc., so I know how to get Brett a Net Revenue
Total *without* *expenses*.  What I could use your help with is defining &
locating all of our expenses so that I can incorporate them in my report.
     -What are our employee expenses and how are they calculated?  (I know
I provide y'all with some commission information, but obviously there's
more to it than that.)
     -Affiliate expenses?  Are these considered part of the above employee
expenses, or something else?  How are these paid?
     -How is the Finance department calculating things like COGS, Shipping
Costs, and Processing Fees?  I have some methods for this in the Data
department, but would be curious to know how or whether our methods differ.
     -Credit Card expenses?  This is something Brett mentioned but I could
use more explanation about what expenses those cover specifically.
    -Any additional expenses I may not be considering.

I realize this is a big ask with a lot of details.  Currently, I can find
some of this information in disparate places but am not always sure of its
accuracy.  If it would be easier I'd be happy to schedule a time for us to
meet to discuss further.  Just let me know what works best for you!

Thank you so much in advance!  I would really appreciate your help and
insight as I try to navigate this new report.

to me
Hey Aubrey, to improve the company and help us navigate the economic
downturn, I'd like to find a way to evaluate where the company is at on the
1st of the month and the 15th.

*The issue is: *the finance department does something called a "close" in
which they need about two weeks to get all the financial data in order and
ensure its accurate before presenting it to me.

And so the data I'm getting is DANGEROUSLY delayed.

Solutions:

1) So obviously you can keep getting me the sales per month on the first of
every month. But I'd also recommend you get me that data on the 15th as
well.

2) The data will be more useful if we can get as many of our expenses into
those reports as soon as possible.
- We can get refunds, chargebacks from Sticky
- We can get acquisition costs from the advertising platforms
- Employee expenses should be fairly predictable and repetitive (can get
data from finance)
- The rest of the expenses are paid every Monday, so finance should be able
to provide that
- The last thing is credit cards, if we pay those 2x weekly, then you
should be able to get the totals of those payments weekly
- There might be other expenses? I would confirm w Andrea

Lastly we can compare your preliminary report w Andrea's "close" report and
see how off they are and why.

But ultimately I'd want to get it within about 5% of difference for the
preliminary.

Preliminary will be slightly less accurate and MUCH faster.

"Close" report will be highly accurately, very slow.

Does this make sense?
