I don=E2=80=99t want declines and tests, no.

Just real processed sales.

Once we have daily ad spend data that should help.

Payroll is predictable.

Finance can tell you whatever other bills they paid.

Only thing is we don=E2=80=99t want to count ad spend twice=E2=80=A6 so may=
be best to just
ad up charges to the cards and not ad spend data from platforms

Does this make Sense?
