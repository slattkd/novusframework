Hi Aubrey,

Thank you for all your hard work. I hope I was not creating any confusion
with the types. I went through and adjusted them. The VSL is a type but
since it is worked on as a project by itself (we are not tracking it here)
you can leave it off your data sheet. I have deleted it.

I have also removed the Research rows for now. I believe it should all flow
better now.
