That=E2=80=99s great! I=E2=80=99ve heard great things about Tableau.

Voluum has 1 years worth of historical data for Adult PPC, Email, Native,
and some Google campaigns (not youtube). We would need to upgrade our
Voluum account plan if we want track data from over a year ago.

We recently started using Voluum tracking for Facebook so we only have
about 3 months of historical data there. For Youtube we thought it was best
to not add Voluum tracking links because we were worried about ad
rejections. We can defiantly revisit this now that we=E2=80=99re not having=
 as many
compliance issues.

Another option would be to cut out Voluum entirely. We may be able to
connect Tableau to all ad platforms directly and cut out the middle man.
Thoughts?
