Hey Jarren,

We=E2=80=99ve been using Voluum to track our daily paid campaign data. Most=
 of our
campaigns have Voluum tracking links set up, except for Youtube ads.

We use Voluum  to track campaign level spend and click data, but we use
ALVR to track sales and revenue data. However, ALVR doesn=E2=80=99t have ca=
mpaign
level sales reporting.

For historical data, I know there are a lot of apps that can be integrated
with the Facebook and Google ads managers to automatically pull that data.

I=E2=80=99d suggest using a BI tool like Tableau to and connecting it with =
ALVR or
Sticky (for sales/revenue), Voluum (for spend/clicks on adult ppc, email,
native) and Ads Managers (for spend/clicks on Facebook, Google, Youtube).

Hope that helps.

Jack
