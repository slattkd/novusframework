Hi!
If we want to track this at the very least at a daily level, then I would
request that we get everything daily that we can.
Moving forward, as things get busier and whatnot, I don't think it's far
off to have all data coming in "live" so at any point anyone that needs the
data would have it as up to date as possible.
If we can get it historically that would be ideal at a daily level as well,
but I do know with some platforms comes hesitations.
The sooner we can get it and start to digest what is there and what is
good/bad, the better.
This might be something that deserves a little bit deeper conversation once
we have the data.

Hope I didn't make that too confusing!  :)
-Jarren
