Hey Jack, so Jarren has Tableau in use already.

The question is how we want to pull the advertising data.

Voluum pulls ad spend directly from all our Google/Facebook accounts?

And it has historic spending data as well?

If so, maybe it's an option to connect to Voluum API to get everything at
once.

Either way, we've still got ad networks that Voluum is not pulling from
that we need to get Jack access to.
