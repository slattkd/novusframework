Hey Kirsten and Brooke, can you review this survey quickly today and let me
know if you have any suggestions to improve it?

https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/vJCzvG

Aubrey, I cc'd you too in case you want to take a look and give feedback
too.

My goal here is to identify *inefficiencies* in the organization that
managers and execs might be blind to.

The goal is *NOT* to assign blame to people.

Just to identify the issues as a group together so that we can all work
together to make the company better.

Inefficiencies drive everyone nuts. They are a problem for the person doing
the work, the manager, me, the person waiting for the work - everyone.

And yet despite everyone technically wanting them gone, due to a myriad of
reasons, efficiencies still exist and we must work together to identify and
remove them.

*Just some context on where this is coming from: *

I've noticed some issues within the copywriting team that are leading
projects that would have taken me 2-4 days to complete to now take 2-3
weeks.

After starting to dig into it, the problem is a combination of writers not
having proper instructions at the start of the project, not assigning the
right writers to the right project and not having a proper template to
follow to enhance quality of work.

There's also problems with the copy review process. Right now Colin needs
to review and then it goes to me. But items for me to review are batched,
meaning they sometimes sit in the batch list for 7+ days before they get to
me. Then I need a lot of time to complete the work, because it's a big
batch of work all at once. So the process was very inefficient and slow
leading to working taking 10-15X longer to get done than is reasonable.

Further, departments that depend on such copy had no agreement with the
copy team on the dates copy would be delivered, so they could never really
justify putting pressure on the copy team for files. These departments have
no idea what is a realistic turnaround time or how busy the department is,
so they sit patiently waiting... in one case for 42 days and counting, for
a single page of copy.

So we've got to identify and stamp out these extreme efficiencies.

In addition to sending out this survey, I am intent on meeting with almost
every single individual in the company to try to get more qualitative
feedback.

I'll compile everything I find into an action plan.
