4 is solid. It's very difficult to do more than that for pure writing.

Completed projects is in the 2nd or 3rd tab as "Archived"

As for efficiency, I think we're just gathering data right now.
But we want to know how many hours of writing a project takes, by type,
writer... but also days.
This will give a better sense of how much time to allocate for a project
for future purposes.
