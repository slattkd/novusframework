- Thanks for adding hours. Traffic report should disappear off your list
soon, freeing up ~2 hrs per week.

- What is the "Daily Reports" that are taking you ~3 hours every day? I
viewed the file but am unclear. This appears it is using almost half of all
your hours.

- I left comments and questions in the spreadsheet both on current reports
and reports below the black line. Can you answer my questions? Note I
indicated reports that are the best to focus on.

- You'll see I sent Greg an email about this "audit" of company reporting
needs. This list below the black line is minimal at best and does not
represent the true reporting needs of the company.

- I noticed for things like the Enrich profit report, you put 4 hours, but
you said previously this is time spent running a Knime routine and, I
assume, you could technically be doing other work. Right now, are you doing
other work while Knime routines are running? Also, I created two separate
columns: one for hours including time to run Knime routine and one for
actual man-hours spent on a task. Can you fill both out please?

- Sales & Profit report can include data through the 15th. Good idea!
