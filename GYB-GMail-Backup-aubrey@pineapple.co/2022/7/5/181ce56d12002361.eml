Hi Brett,

Yes, I do believe that I will be able to find Affiliate Commissions by
month for the last year using CAKE.  Your request seems pretty straight
forward but if I do have any questions crop up I will be sure to reach
out!

I should be able to have this to you by the EOD tomorrow, but I'll
certainly keep you updated if it takes longer than expected.

Thanks!
