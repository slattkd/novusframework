Hi Ryan,

Happy to look into this for you!  The second report request should be no
problem-- seems straightforward enough and I know where to find this
information in CAKE.

I do have a couple questions regarding the first report so that I can
confirm what you're looking for:
1. a) When you say "Exact Average Payout", you're looking for a daily
average (per month) that we payout to each individual Affiliate, rather
than the monthly total?  Or are you wanting an average payout across the
last 3 months?
    b) Is there a specific Offer for Montezuma that you are wanting me to
review?  In looking at CAKE I see Offer 94 for Montezuma, which has several
affiliates in the campaign; however, I'm not all that familiar with Offers
so I thought I'd ask for clarification here.
2. Would you like the averages for these products all together, or
individually by product?  Also wondering if you want me to include Active
BF or Pure-FX products, since they're also in the RPT-Enrich category?
3. For Affiliate Manager Payouts, do you want the total to each AM by
individual product by month, or total by month for all of these products
combined?

Thanks in advance for clarifying!  I'll be sure to start on these reports
ASAP.
