Hi Brett,

Just to make sure I'm understanding correctly:  On the 15th you'd like
sales for the first 2 weeks of that month.  So, for example, tomorrow I
will provide you with sales numbers for July 1-14.
Additionally, I will continue to give you sales for the prior month on the
1st of every month.  Specifically I will be giving you Gross Revenue -
Declines, with Tests excluded.

If that is correct, I'd be happy to do that for you.

It will take me a bit more time to create a report that incorporates all of
our expenses.  I'm trying to do something similar for Jarren in this Master
Product List,
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16htty6f8tnuXLUaMJBKVyvnEgFpoedhWSknSh6ey5jI/edit?usp=sharing>
so I do already have a bit of a head start there.  Thank you for the
details regarding where to find those other expenses, I'll start to work on
getting all of them accounted for and laid out.  Certain things will be
easier for me to get in there first, like refunds & chargebacks, so I will
start with those and build out as quickly as I'm able.

Thanks!
Aubrey
