Hey Aubrey, to improve the company and help us navigate the economic
downturn, I'd like to find a way to evaluate where the company is at on the
1st of the month and the 15th.

*The issue is: *the finance department does something called a "close" in
which they need about two weeks to get all the financial data in order and
ensure its accurate before presenting it to me.

And so the data I'm getting is DANGEROUSLY delayed.

Solutions:

1) So obviously you can keep getting me the sales per month on the first of
every month. But I'd also recommend you get me that data on the 15th as
well.

2) The data will be more useful if we can get as many of our expenses into
those reports as soon as possible.
- We can get refunds, chargebacks from Sticky
- We can get acquisition costs from the advertising platforms
- Employee expenses should be fairly predictable and repetitive (can get
data from finance)
- The rest of the expenses are paid every Monday, so finance should be able
to provide that
- The last thing is credit cards, if we pay those 2x weekly, then you
should be able to get the totals of those payments weekly
- There might be other expenses? I would confirm w Andrea

Lastly we can compare your preliminary report w Andrea's "close" report and
see how off they are and why.

But ultimately I'd want to get it within about 5% of difference for the
preliminary.

Preliminary will be slightly less accurate and MUCH faster.

"Close" report will be highly accurately, very slow.

Does this make sense?
