Hey Aubrey, really appreciate you keeping the deadline for Bob, I think he
will appreciate that too.

I think for now, it's fine to share your findings with him tomorrow and let
him know the next steps you'll be taking.

I guess those next steps are:

1) Figure out overpayments from past

2) Figure out undercalculations from recent calculations

Yeah?
