#1 - Ok so did we overpay them? If so, how much in total? And were we
undercalculating payments recently? If so, what were the old numbers vs the
correct numbers?

#2 - Getting pretty confused here. The fact that the say the data from
Knime "does not make sense" is concerning, but I'm unable to make any
conclusions from anything you write after this.

I don't really want to get in the weeds and go through this point by point
unless you're totally lost and have no other way to figure things out.

I also ideally wouldn't want to go through spreadsheet data.

This is where I think there's an opportunity to a) understand the business
better and b) do more analysis and reporting on that analysis by basically
boiling everything down to concrete takeaways I'd want to know based on
what matters to the business.

So I'd want to know:

- Were we overpaying or underpaying before?

- If we were overpaying, by how much?

- If underpaying, by how much?

- Are we overpaying or underpaying now since Brooke's product
reclassification?

- If we were overpaying, by how much?

- If underpaying, by how much?
