Brett,

My main takeaway here is that I have an answer to Bob's question, as well
as revised Gross Revenue numbers to provide him with.  I thought it was
important to try to explain that there was a reason for why the Gross
Revenue for the Enrich Montezuma funnel was inaccurate historically.  I had
given him a deadline of responding by tomorrow, so I was trying to hold
true to that.

1. I can say that we did overpay Enrich, though I still need to do more
work in order to determine exactly how much each month.  I realized after
the re-run that there were further adjustments that needed to be made, as
Profit was not being calculated properly in the KNIME routine.  This change
is apart from the ones that I had to do with Brooke to make sure Products
were properly categorized, and affects the Enrich Payout, not the Gross
Revenue values.

2. I was explaining why the data from KNIME didn't make sense, only insofar
as to explain why additional changes need to be made.  I understand where
the routine is going wrong and I am already working on fixing it and
re-running the routine.

Going forward, I won't break things down to this extent unless you ask me
to.  Please know that I am currently working on finding exact answers to
the last questions you posed.

If you want me to wait to reply to Bob regarding Gross Revenue numbers
until I've completely worked out the monthly Payout numbers, I will send
him a revised deadline.

Thanks,
Aubrey
