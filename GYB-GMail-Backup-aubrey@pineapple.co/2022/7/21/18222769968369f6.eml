ect that we were not properly accounting for Gross Revenue.=C2=A0 I discove=
red that the issue related to the re-organizing of our products in Sticky a=
nd was two-fold: First, there were some Enrich Info Products that <b>were n=
ot</b> being included in the funnel<i> after</i> the Product Category chang=
es were made.=C2=A0 This was our error and is why the Gross Revenue appeare=
d to be so much lower than it should be.=C2=A0 Second, there were some SNM-=
Enrich products that <b>were </b>being included in the funnel <i>before</i>=
 the Product Category changes were made.=C2=A0 So in this case, the Gross R=
evenue for the Enrich Montezuma funnel <i>is </i>lower and<i> should be</i>=
.=C2=A0 This was a categorization mistake that I can verify happened in 202=
0 and 2021.=C2=A0</div><div>You can review this information on the first ta=
b of the attachment.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2. Regarding Monthly Payou=
ts to Enrich:</b></div><div>I do not believe this is part of what Bob is as=
king for, but is critical in determining whether we&#39;ve overpaid Enrich =
in the past.=C2=A0 This data can be found on the second tab of the attachme=
nt.</div><div>Upon rerunning the chain in full, the routine resulted in Enr=
ich Payout values that were at times <i>higher</i> than they were before.=
=C2=A0 This does not make sense for 2 reasons: First, the Total Gross Reven=
ue was lower for Enrich Montezuma, so it would follow that the profit (and =
the 41.5% profit share due to Enrich) should also be lower.=C2=A0 Second, i=
t would make sense that things like Refunds and Chargebacks have increased =
since the original time the routine was run, so again, profit should be low=
er.</div><div>Here is where point 3 comes into play.</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>3. <b>Regarding the &quot;Cost Breakdown&quot;, i.e. How is this routine=
 calculating profit?:</b></div><div>You can find this data on the third tab=
 of the attachment.=C2=A0 You&#39;ll notice that &quot;Shipping Loss&quot; =
(in column G)-- one of the expenses taken from Revenue in order to get to P=
rofit-- for the original run is more than 10x what it was on the rerun.=C2=
=A0 I discovered that this is because the KNIME routine also uses Product C=
ategories in order to define shipping costs.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll need to make ad=
justments here and to re-run the routine yet again so that I can properly c=
apture what our Payout should have been each month.=C2=A0 This will obvious=
ly require more time unfortunately.</div><div>Regardless, the calculated=C2=
=A0payout is on average less than the $50k we are required to pay each mont=
h, and is likely substantially lower considering the routine was not proper=
ly accounting for shipping costs.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I=
&#39;ll look forward to hearing from you before I try to convey this to Bob=
