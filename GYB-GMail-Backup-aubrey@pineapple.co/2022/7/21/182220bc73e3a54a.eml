Hey Ian, I just want to intro you to Aubrey.

I was thinking you guys could get maybe four weekly 30-minute meetings on
the books and then go from there?

If you think 45-60 minutes is better, let me know.

Two things to focus on:

1) Do a data download about what you were doing at the company, what data
you looked after and why it was important and what else you had planned to
do in the future that you didn=E2=80=99t get to do yet.

Goal #1 is for Aubrey to create a list of reports that she should be
running to give us more business intelligence.

I want to make sure we=E2=80=99re tracking all the stats and reports we use=
d to
track and also that we start to finally address those bucket list stats and
reports to improve the business.

Goal #2, I want to bring Aubrey some of the institutional knowledge you
have.

2) Review some of her Knime routines and just be a second set of eyes.

This is not ongoing work, just a one-time review.

We found some issues recently that impacted new product
classification/grouping Brooke created in Sticky. It would probably be
worth it for you to review Brooke's grouping/classification as well. I'm
sure she has documentation on that.

This probably wouldn't be done on a call w Aubrey and best done on your own
and then reporting your findings back to Aubrey and myself.

Perhaps you and Aubrey can identify the highest leverage routines for you
to evaluate.

For example, the Weekly Sales and Weekly Affiliate report are not worth
reviewing because we are moving those to Tableau.
