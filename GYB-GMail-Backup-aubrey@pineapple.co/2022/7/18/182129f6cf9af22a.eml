Hi Brett,

-I noted that the "Daily Reports" take 1.5-2 hours, though it's slightly
less for actual man hours since things take time to load & export.  It is
the longest on Monday as I have to input data for Friday, Saturday, &
Sunday; all other days are only for the day prior.  Almost all of those
metrics (columns C-AB on the "Possible Structure" tab) take me about 30
minutes to compile, as they're located in disparate places in Sticky,
Kount, and Chargeback Hero/Midigator.  What takes the longest is the "Orders
to Review for Refunding
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHp9qvXxO0McoeU1V9tfx5bPQuBm6geL/edit>"
(column AC).  This usually takes 40 minutes or more per day, as I am
manually combing through all Billing Cycle 0 orders for a given day to look
for red flags that might indicate fraud, or duplicate orders that need to
be refunded.  This is usually 300-400 orders for each day.  Therefore, on a
Monday I'm likely spending over 1.5 hours (3 days X 40 minutes each) on
reviewing refunds alone.

-Regarding your questions, I left comments for you on the spreadsheet so
that it might be easier to keep straight.  I've done my best to find
answers to your questions but I unfortunately do not have much information
on the notes below the black line, as they were taken by Greg from
conversations he had with other parties.  I saw your email to Greg but it
doesn't seem like he'll be able to elaborate really.

-I've filled out the "Man-Hours Spent" column.  Most of the KNIME routines
other than the Enrich Profit reporting only take a matter or minutes to
run. But yes, generally I am working on other tasks while I have KNIME
routines running, especially if it's long like the Enrich one.

-I'll send you corrected revenue numbers through the 15th shortly.  I'm
also going to send you Doug's commissions for a year to answer that
question from the spreadsheet.

Thanks!
Aubrey
