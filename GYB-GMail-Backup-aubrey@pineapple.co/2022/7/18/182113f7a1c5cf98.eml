Hey Aubrey,=20

Hope you had a better weekend than mine. I had to work, whomp whomp.=20

Today=E2=80=99s pretty busy, but we could definitely have a quick meeting to=
 make sure we=E2=80=99re all on the same page & then catch back up later in t=
he week, if that makes sense. I=E2=80=99m looping in Megan cause she=E2=80=99=
ll probably have more to say about the affiliates, etc.=20

I=E2=80=99d also like us to compare sticky reports to make sure we=E2=80=99r=
e not duplicating work (we format one as well to pull out top sales, voids, r=
efunds & declines. I=E2=80=99m trying to keep 12-2 open for a lunch date wit=
h my friend either today or Wednesday, but my otherwise pretty available, ex=
cept 2-2:15. Lmk what works for you.=20

 navigate the economic downturn, I'd like to find a way to evaluate where th=
e company is at on the 1st of the month and the 15th.<div><br></div><div><b>=
The issue is:&nbsp;</b>the finance department does something called a "close=
" in which they need about two weeks to get all the financial data in order a=
nd ensure its accurate before presenting it to me.</div><div><br></div><div>=
And so the data I'm getting is DANGEROUSLY delayed.</div><div><br></div><div=
>Solutions:</div><div><br></div><div>1) So obviously you can keep getting me=
 the sales per month on the first of every month. But I'd also recommend you=
 get me that data on the 15th as well.<br></div><div><br></div><div>2) The d=
ata will be more useful if we can get as many of our expenses into those rep=
orts as soon as possible.&nbsp;</div><div>- We can get refunds, chargebacks f=
rom Sticky</div><div>- We can get acquisition costs from the advertising pla=
tforms</div><div>- Employee expenses should be fairly predictable and repeti=
tive (can get data from finance)</div><div>- The rest of the expenses are pa=
id every Monday, so finance should be able to provide that</div><div>- The l=
ast thing is credit cards, if we pay those 2x weekly, then you should be abl=
e to get the totals of those payments weekly</div><div>- There might be othe=
r expenses? I would confirm w Andrea</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly we can c=
ompare your preliminary report w Andrea's "close" report and see how off the=
y are and why.</div><div><br></div><div>But ultimately I'd want to get it wi=
thin about 5% of difference for the preliminary.</div><div><br></div><div>Pr=
eliminary will be slightly less accurate and MUCH faster.</div><div><br></di=
v><div>"Close" report will be highly accurately, very slow.</div><div><br></=
div><div>Does this make sense?<br></div></div></div></div></div><div><br></d=
iv></div></div>
