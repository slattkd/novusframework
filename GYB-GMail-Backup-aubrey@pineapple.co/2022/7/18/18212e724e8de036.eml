OK so the goal is to automate the fraud aspect of it as soon as Jarren is
done with this first round of reports (LTV, weekly sales, weekly affiliate).

We can automate the duplicate orders check too.

If we do this via Jarren, this can cut your workload 4.16 hours per week.

I reviewed the man hours spent, looks fine.

Regarding reports other people need, I'd scratch Greg's list as it's poorly
documented and clear not thorough.

Please be *VERY SKEPTICAL* of everything Greg told you.

I realize that might be kind of a bomb to drop since you're basically doing
everything you're doing based on what Greg told you.

Which is why I would love it if you work with Ian Moskowitz to double check
all your routine logic.

I'm talking to Ian right now about a temporary engagement.

Jarren's reports should start to free up some of your time (weekly traffic,
affiliate, fraud and duplicate customer reports)

Then you can dedicate your time to manual activities that aren't worth
using Tableau for.

Does that make sense?
