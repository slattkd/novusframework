re I shared it with Robert in case you had any questions.=C2=A0=C2=A0</div>=
<div><br></div><div>When calculating the monthly Enrich Payouts, I employ a=
 KNIME routine that Greg trained me to use.=C2=A0 In a nutshell, the routin=
e uses Sticky&#39;s &quot;Product Category&quot; to lump sales into further=
 subcategories-- first, whether they are or are not Enrich (for this routin=
e, we&#39;re just looking at the Enrich products specifically); and second,=
 if they are Enrich, it puts them into 3 funnels, Enrich Montezuma, Enrich =
Info Products, and Enrich Flavo Trim.=C2=A0 This routine worked as it was m=
eant to until we started to change our Product Category naming conventions =
in Sticky a few months ago.=C2=A0 While the changes to the names are necess=
ary, I don&#39;t think Greg foresaw the effects this would have on the way =
this KNIME routine works.=C2=A0 When I tried to perform the routine as I ha=
d in previous months at the end of May, I ran into trouble and could tell t=
hat the outputs were not correct.=C2=A0 Namely, I was getting negative numb=
ers for revenue, and therefore also the payout.</div><div><br>With that sai=
d, I&#39;ve been working since then to correct the routine.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve =
met with Brooke several times and she has been an immense help.=C2=A0 Unfor=
tunately neither Mike nor Jarren are familiar with this routine/report, and=
 it will require the most work to replicate on a different platform (accord=
ing to what Greg told me previously).=C2=A0 I was able to solve the Product=
 Category naming issue and get things into the right funnel, and I also add=
ed a new funnel/started reporting on Genetic Peak, which hadn&#39;t been in=
corporated=C2=A0yet.=C2=A0 However, the Gross Revenue for the Enrich Montez=
uma &amp; Enrich Info Products was coming up as much lower than it was prev=
iously.</div><div><br></div><div>At the time, I was unsure of how to resolv=
e this issue entirely, but Bob&#39;s email gave me an idea of how to check =
for &quot;historical&quot; data in Sticky.=C2=A0 Let me explain this a litt=
le further: When the Product Category in Sticky changed, it changed for all=
 sales, going back to 5/2020.=C2=A0 This seems obvious and makes sense, but=
=C2=A0when I wanted to see if there were any products in what was formerly =
Product Category &quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - SMC&quot;, I can&#39;t tell=
, as those have all changed to their new &quot;SNM-Enrich&quot; names.=C2=
=A0 By manually looking through old exports of Sticky data from 2020 and 20=
21, which were sent to me by Greg when I first started, I was able to see t=
hat some PIDs were miscategorized either before or after the changing of ou=
r Product Categories.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For example, the reason =
Info Products&#39; revenue was appearing so much lower in May than it had i=
n February, was because PID 469, &quot;The Pursuit Institute Rebill&quot;, =
had been placed in the &quot;Gotham - Archived&quot; category, rather than =
the &quot;Info Products - GDC - SMC&quot; category it needed to be in for t=
he KNIME routine to recognize it and put it in its appropriate funnel.=C2=
=A0 Therefore it was being excluded from the funnel and its revenue was not=
 accounted for.=C2=A0 Now that PID469 has been added back to that category,=
 you&#39;ll see in the attachment that the monthly Gross Revenue values are=
 back to what Bob was referencing.=C2=A0=C2=A0</div><div>In the opposite di=
rection, I found that there were some products that were placed in the old =
&quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - SNMC&quot; category (which becomes the=C2=A0=
Enrich Montezuma funnel in the routine) that are in fact <b>not </b>Enrich =
products.=C2=A0 For example, there were times in 2020/21 that Volumizer and=
 Testosterone Booster were in that category erroneously.=C2=A0 Moreover, Be=
come Supernatural (specifically PIDs 616 &amp; 617) were being attributed a=
s Fran products when in fact they are not.=C2=A0 Gene was able to confirm t=
his for us today and Brooke changed all the products to their appropriate c=
ategory so that I could rerun the routine.</div><div><br></div><div>The att=
achment I have here is a revised monthly Gross Revenue for all 4 Enrich pro=
duct funnels.=C2=A0 Genetic Peak and Flavo Trim were being properly account=
ed for already, but now Info Products has been restored to its former total=
 with all of the products properly categorized.=C2=A0 I imagine that Bob is=
 most concerned with Info Products specifically, so I&#39;m happy to say th=
at issue has been resolved.</div><div>Montezuma&#39;s Gross Revenue, howeve=
r, is indeed slightly lower than it once was calculated to be.=C2=A0 As far=
 as I can tell with=C2=A0the data I have available, what is attached should=
 be accurate now that those miscategorized products have been removed.=C2=
=A0 While I can&#39;t explain exactly how or why they were in the wrong pla=
ce, I think these issues all just speak to the inefficacy of, and potential=
 for error with, KNIME routines.=C2=A0 [If you would like me to send you th=
e old Sticky export with the specifics of which PIDs were miscategorized pr=
eviously as an example, I can do that.]</div><div><br></div><div>If you hav=

This suggests a systemic problem with your accounting (at least as it relat=

 sales are, how do you have any confidence in the numbers?</div>

<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">
<ul style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">Each month we have been provided wi=
th a report by you that shows sales to date by product by month since May, =
2020.</li><ul style=3D"list-style-type:circle;font-family:Georgia,serif">
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">The cumulative total is needed to c=
ompute the cumulative total gross profit, which is needed to determine the =
current revenue share payment.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">The most recent report provided sho=
ws prior period sales numbers for the info products and Montezuma product a=
s being much lower than has been shown on reports provided to us in the pas=
t.</li><ul style=3D"list-style-type:circle;font-family:Georgia,serif">
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">For example, sales for info product=
s in Feb 2021 were reported as $21,578 at the time and on subsequent report=
s until the recent one, which shows sales for that month of only $7,905, or=
 $13,673 less than originally and
 consistently reported.=C2=A0</li><li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">I=
n total, all products, all time periods since inception, showed sales throu=
gh Feb 2022 of $7,049,435. The most recent report provided by you shows sal=
es of all products through Feb. 2022 of only $6,542,032. That is $507,403
 less than shown on prior reports.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">With all due respect, the pointed q=
uestion is: Were the systems and process to capture sales by product messed=
 up all along, and have now been corrected, or were they proper and accurat=
e all along and are now messed up?</li><ul style=3D"list-style-type:circle;=
font-family:Georgia,serif">
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">If the answer is the former, that r=
aises a lot of questions about the veracity of the cost and expense numbers=
, and requires a detailed explanation of what was so terribly wrong. ($500,=
000 is not a minor adjustment.)=C2=A0</li><li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,=
serif">If the answer is the later, there is something on your end that need=
s to be fixed to get accurate sales numbers, something I hope we all agree =
is pretty fundamental to running a business.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">And to be clear, this is not about =
a decline in sales now, compared prior periods. This is about a
<i style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">material</i>=C2=A0<i style=3D"font-f=
amily:Georgia,serif">change
</i>to numbers that are not supposed to change for prior periods.=C2=A0</li=
></ul>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Ho=
ping this helps explain both the concern and the depth of the concern. Once=
 you appoint the most appropriate person, I have detailed schedules I can s=
hare, which of course I am happy
 to share with you as well.=C2=A0</div>

 on a cumulative basis -- total sales since start minus total expenses sinc=
e start -- to arrive at the gross
 profit. It has to be this way because many expenses such as returns and ch=
arge-backs occur after the period in which the sale occurred. Then the curr=
ent revenue share amount is determined by applying the percentage to the to=

 less prior revenue share payments made.</div>

 no sense. Subject to further investigation and analysis, the current concl=

 restated numbers now being presented are grossly wrong. Neither of those b=
