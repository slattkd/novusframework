Of course!

My summary of the key takeaway is this: Due to our changes in product
categories in Sticky, there were some products in the Info Product funnel
that were not being properly captured by the KNIME routine in my previous
report.  I have fixed that issue but in doing so, revealed that there were
also some products in the "SNM-Enrich" category that were previously being
counted as Enrich products but should not have been.

That explains the discrepancy with Gross Revenue for those two funnels.

ating the monthly Enrich Payouts, I employ a KNIME routine that Greg traine=

ct Category&quot; to lump sales into further subcategories-- first, whether=
 they are or are not Enrich (for this routine, we&#39;re just looking at th=
e Enrich products specifically); and second, if they are Enrich, it puts th=
em into 3 funnels, Enrich Montezuma, Enrich Info Products, and Enrich Flavo=
 Trim.=C2=A0 This routine worked as it was meant to until we started to cha=
nge our Product Category naming conventions in Sticky a few months ago.=C2=
=A0 While the changes to the names are necessary, I don&#39;t think Greg fo=
resaw the effects this would have on the way this KNIME routine works.=C2=
=A0 When I tried to perform the routine as I had in previous months at the =
end of May, I ran into trouble and could tell that the outputs were not cor=
rect.=C2=A0 Namely, I was getting negative numbers for revenue, and therefo=
re also the payout.</div><div><br>With that said, I&#39;ve been working sin=
ce then to correct the routine.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve met with Brooke several time=
s and she has been an immense help.=C2=A0 Unfortunately neither Mike nor Ja=
rren are familiar with this routine/report, and it will require the most wo=
rk to replicate on a different platform (according to what Greg told me pre=
viously).=C2=A0 I was able to solve the Product Category naming issue and g=
et things into the right funnel, and I also added a new funnel/started repo=
rting on Genetic Peak, which hadn&#39;t been incorporated=C2=A0yet.=C2=A0 H=
owever, the Gross Revenue for the Enrich Montezuma &amp; Enrich Info Produc=
ts was coming up as much lower than it was previously.</div><div><br></div>=
<div>At the time, I was unsure of how to resolve this issue entirely, but B=
ob&#39;s email gave me an idea of how to check for &quot;historical&quot; d=
ata in Sticky.=C2=A0 Let me explain this a little further: When the Product=
 Category in Sticky changed, it changed for all sales, going back to 5/2020=
.=C2=A0 This seems obvious and makes sense, but=C2=A0when I wanted to see i=
f there were any products in what was formerly Product Category &quot;Male =
Enhancement - SNM - SMC&quot;, I can&#39;t tell, as those have all changed =
to their new &quot;SNM-Enrich&quot; names.=C2=A0 By manually looking throug=
h old exports of Sticky data from 2020 and 2021, which were sent to me by G=
reg when I first started, I was able to see that some PIDs were miscategori=
zed either before or after the changing of our Product Categories.<br></div=
><div><br></div><div>For example, the reason Info Products&#39; revenue was=
 appearing so much lower in May than it had in February, was because PID 46=
9, &quot;The Pursuit Institute Rebill&quot;, had been placed in the &quot;G=
otham - Archived&quot; category, rather than the &quot;Info Products - GDC =
- SMC&quot; category it needed to be in for the KNIME routine to recognize =
it and put it in its appropriate funnel.=C2=A0 Therefore it was being exclu=
ded from the funnel and its revenue was not accounted for.=C2=A0 Now that P=
ID469 has been added back to that category, you&#39;ll see in the attachmen=
t that the monthly Gross Revenue values are back to what Bob was referencin=
g.=C2=A0=C2=A0</div><div>In the opposite direction, I found that there were=
 some products that were placed in the old &quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - S=
NMC&quot; category (which becomes the=C2=A0Enrich Montezuma funnel in the r=
outine) that are in fact <b>not </b>Enrich products.=C2=A0 For example, the=
re were times in 2020/21 that Volumizer and Testosterone Booster were in th=
at category erroneously.=C2=A0 Moreover, Become Supernatural (specifically =
PIDs 616 &amp; 617) were being attributed as Fran products when in fact the=
y are not.=C2=A0 Gene was able to confirm this for us today and Brooke chan=
ged all the products to their appropriate category so that I could rerun th=
e routine.</div><div><br></div><div>The attachment I have here is a revised=
 monthly Gross Revenue for all 4 Enrich product funnels.=C2=A0 Genetic Peak=
 and Flavo Trim were being properly accounted for already, but now Info Pro=
ducts has been restored to its former total with all of the products proper=
ly categorized.=C2=A0 I imagine that Bob is most concerned with Info Produc=
ts specifically, so I&#39;m happy to say that issue has been resolved.</div=
><div>Montezuma&#39;s Gross Revenue, however, is indeed slightly lower than=
 it once was calculated to be.=C2=A0 As far as I can tell with=C2=A0the dat=
a I have available, what is attached should be accurate now that those misc=
ategorized products have been removed.=C2=A0 While I can&#39;t explain exac=
tly how or why they were in the wrong place, I think these issues all just =
speak to the inefficacy of, and potential for error with, KNIME routines.=

 that.]</div><div><br></div><div>If you have any questions or would like to=

<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">For example, sales for info product=
s in Feb 2021 were reported as $21,578 at the time and on subsequent report=

 $13,673 less than originally and
 consistently reported.=C2=A0</li><li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">I=

 less than shown on prior reports.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">With all due respect, the pointed q=

<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">If the answer is the former, that r=

is pretty fundamental to running a business.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">And to be clear, this is not about =
