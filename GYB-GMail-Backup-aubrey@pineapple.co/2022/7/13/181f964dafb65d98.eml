Hi Brett,

I wanted to send this your way before I shared it with Robert in case you
had any questions.

When calculating the monthly Enrich Payouts, I employ a KNIME routine that
Greg trained me to use.  In a nutshell, the routine uses Sticky's "Product
Category" to lump sales into further subcategories-- first, whether they
are or are not Enrich (for this routine, we're just looking at the Enrich
products specifically); and second, if they are Enrich, it puts them into 3
funnels, Enrich Montezuma, Enrich Info Products, and Enrich Flavo Trim.
This routine worked as it was meant to until we started to change our
Product Category naming conventions in Sticky a few months ago.  While the
changes to the names are necessary, I don't think Greg foresaw the effects
this would have on the way this KNIME routine works.  When I tried to
perform the routine as I had in previous months at the end of May, I ran
into trouble and could tell that the outputs were not correct.  Namely, I
was getting negative numbers for revenue, and therefore also the payout.

With that said, I've been working since then to correct the routine.  I've
met with Brooke several times and she has been an immense help.
Unfortunately neither Mike nor Jarren are familiar with this
routine/report, and it will require the most work to replicate on a
different platform (according to what Greg told me previously).  I was able
to solve the Product Category naming issue and get things into the right
funnel, and I also added a new funnel/started reporting on Genetic Peak,
which hadn't been incorporated yet.  However, the Gross Revenue for the
Enrich Montezuma & Enrich Info Products was coming up as much lower than it
was previously.

At the time, I was unsure of how to resolve this issue entirely, but Bob's
email gave me an idea of how to check for "historical" data in Sticky.  Let
me explain this a little further: When the Product Category in Sticky
changed, it changed for all sales, going back to 5/2020.  This seems
obvious and makes sense, but when I wanted to see if there were any
products in what was formerly Product Category "Male Enhancement - SNM -
SMC", I can't tell, as those have all changed to their new "SNM-Enrich"
names.  By manually looking through old exports of Sticky data from 2020
and 2021, which were sent to me by Greg when I first started, I was able to
see that some PIDs were miscategorized either before or after the changing
of our Product Categories.

For example, the reason Info Products' revenue was appearing so much lower
in May than it had in February, was because PID 469, "The Pursuit Institute
Rebill", had been placed in the "Gotham - Archived" category, rather than
the "Info Products - GDC - SMC" category it needed to be in for the KNIME
routine to recognize it and put it in its appropriate funnel.  Therefore it
was being excluded from the funnel and its revenue was not accounted for.
Now that PID469 has been added back to that category, you'll see in the
attachment that the monthly Gross Revenue values are back to what Bob was
referencing.
In the opposite direction, I found that there were some products that were
placed in the old "Male Enhancement - SNM - SNMC" category (which becomes
the Enrich Montezuma funnel in the routine) that are in fact *not *Enrich
products.  For example, there were times in 2020/21 that Volumizer and
Testosterone Booster were in that category erroneously.  Moreover, Become
Supernatural (specifically PIDs 616 & 617) were being attributed as Fran
products when in fact they are not.  Gene was able to confirm this for us
today and Brooke changed all the products to their appropriate category so
that I could rerun the routine.

The attachment I have here is a revised monthly Gross Revenue for all 4
Enrich product funnels.  Genetic Peak and Flavo Trim were being properly
accounted for already, but now Info Products has been restored to its
former total with all of the products properly categorized.  I imagine that
Bob is most concerned with Info Products specifically, so I'm happy to say
that issue has been resolved.
Montezuma's Gross Revenue, however, is indeed slightly lower than it once
was calculated to be.  As far as I can tell with the data I have available,
what is attached should be accurate now that those miscategorized products
have been removed.  While I can't explain exactly how or why they were in
the wrong place, I think these issues all just speak to the inefficacy of,
and potential for error with, KNIME routines.  [If you would like me to
send you the old Sticky export with the specifics of which PIDs were
miscategorized previously as an example, I can do that.]

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, let me know.

Thank you!
Aubrey

<div dir=3D"ltr">Hi Brett,<div><br></div><div>I wanted to send this your wa=
y before I shared it with Robert in case you had any questions.=C2=A0=C2=A0=
</div><div><br></div><div>When calculating the monthly Enrich Payouts, I em=
ploy a KNIME routine that Greg trained me to use.=C2=A0 In a nutshell, the =
routine uses Sticky&#39;s &quot;Product Category&quot; to lump sales into f=
urther subcategories-- first, whether they are or are not Enrich (for this =
routine, we&#39;re just looking at the Enrich products specifically); and s=
econd, if they are Enrich, it puts them into 3 funnels, Enrich Montezuma, E=
nrich Info Products, and Enrich Flavo Trim.=C2=A0 This routine worked as it=
 was meant to until we started to change our Product Category naming conven=
tions in Sticky a few months ago.=C2=A0 While the changes to the names are =
necessary, I don&#39;t think Greg foresaw the effects this would have on th=
e way this KNIME routine works.=C2=A0 When I tried to perform the routine a=
s I had in previous months at the end of May, I ran into trouble and could =
tell that the outputs were not correct.=C2=A0 Namely, I was getting negativ=
e numbers for revenue, and therefore also the payout.</div><div><br>With th=
at said, I&#39;ve been working since then to correct the routine.=C2=A0 I&#=
39;ve met with Brooke several times and she has been an immense help.=C2=A0=
 Unfortunately neither Mike nor Jarren are familiar with this routine/repor=
t, and it will require the most work to replicate on a different platform (=
according to what Greg told me previously).=C2=A0 I was able to solve the P=
roduct Category naming issue and get things into the right funnel, and I al=
so added a new funnel/started reporting on Genetic Peak, which hadn&#39;t b=
een incorporated=C2=A0yet.=C2=A0 However, the Gross Revenue for the Enrich =
Montezuma &amp; Enrich Info Products was coming up as much lower than it wa=
s previously.</div><div><br></div><div>At the time, I was unsure of how to =
resolve this issue entirely, but Bob&#39;s email gave me an idea of how to =
check for &quot;historical&quot; data in Sticky.=C2=A0 Let me explain this =
a little further: When the Product Category in Sticky changed, it changed f=
or all sales, going back to 5/2020.=C2=A0 This seems obvious and makes sens=
e, but=C2=A0when I wanted to see if there were any products in what was for=
merly Product Category &quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - SMC&quot;, I can&#39;=
t tell, as those have all changed to their new &quot;SNM-Enrich&quot; names=
.=C2=A0 By manually looking through old exports of Sticky data from 2020 an=
d 2021, which were sent to me by Greg when I first started, I was able to s=
ee that some PIDs were miscategorized either before or after the changing o=
f our Product Categories.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For example, the rea=
son Info Products&#39; revenue was appearing so much lower in May than it h=
ad in February, was because PID 469, &quot;The Pursuit Institute Rebill&quo=
t;, had been placed in the &quot;Gotham - Archived&quot; category, rather t=
han the &quot;Info Products - GDC - SMC&quot; category it needed to be in f=
or the KNIME routine to recognize it and put it in its appropriate funnel.=
=C2=A0 Therefore it was being excluded from the funnel and its revenue was =
not accounted for.=C2=A0 Now that PID469 has been added back to that catego=
ry, you&#39;ll see in the attachment that the monthly Gross Revenue values =
are back to what Bob was referencing.=C2=A0=C2=A0</div><div>In the opposite=
 direction, I found that there were some products that were placed in the o=
ld &quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - SNMC&quot; category (which becomes the=C2=
=A0Enrich Montezuma funnel in the routine) that are in fact <b>not </b>Enri=
ch products.=C2=A0 For example, there were times in 2020/21 that Volumizer =
and Testosterone Booster were in that category erroneously.=C2=A0 Moreover,=
 Become Supernatural (specifically PIDs 616 &amp; 617) were being attribute=
d as Fran products when in fact they are not.=C2=A0 Gene was able to confir=
m this for us today and Brooke changed all the products to their appropriat=
e category so that I could rerun the routine.</div><div><br></div><div>The =
attachment I have here is a revised monthly Gross Revenue for all 4 Enrich =
product funnels.=C2=A0 Genetic Peak and Flavo Trim were being properly acco=
unted for already, but now Info Products has been restored to its former to=
tal with all of the products properly categorized.=C2=A0 I imagine that Bob=
 is most concerned with Info Products specifically, so I&#39;m happy to say=
 that issue has been resolved.</div><div>Montezuma&#39;s Gross Revenue, how=
ever, is indeed slightly lower than it once was calculated to be.=C2=A0 As =
far as I can tell with=C2=A0the data I have available, what is attached sho=
uld be accurate now that those miscategorized products have been removed.=
=C2=A0 While I can&#39;t explain exactly how or why they were in the wrong =
place, I think these issues all just speak to the inefficacy of, and potent=
ial for error with, KNIME routines.=C2=A0 [If you would like me to send you=
 the old Sticky export with the specifics of which PIDs were miscategorized=
 previously as an example, I can do that.]</div><div><br></div><div>If you =
have any questions or would like to discuss further, let me know.</div><div=

 on a cumulative basis -- total sales since start minus total expenses sinc=

 profit. It has to be this way because many expenses such as returns and ch=
arge-backs occur after the period in which the sale occurred. Then the curr=

My understanding is that part of the urgency is not because of our Pineappl=

rrectly without the accurate back data (Bob correct me if I&#39;m wrong - I=
