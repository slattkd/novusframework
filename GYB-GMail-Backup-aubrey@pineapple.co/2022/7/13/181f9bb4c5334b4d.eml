 the monthly Enrich Payouts, I employ a KNIME routine that Greg trained me =
to use.=C2=A0 In a nutshell, the routine uses Sticky&#39;s &quot;Product Ca=
tegory&quot; to lump sales into further subcategories-- first, whether they=
 are or are not Enrich (for this routine, we&#39;re just looking at the Enr=
ich products specifically); and second, if they are Enrich, it puts them in=
to 3 funnels, Enrich Montezuma, Enrich Info Products, and Enrich Flavo Trim=
.=C2=A0 This routine worked as it was meant to until we started to change o=
ur Product Category naming conventions in Sticky a few months ago.=C2=A0 Wh=
ile the changes to the names are necessary, I don&#39;t think Greg foresaw =
the effects this would have on the way this KNIME routine works.=C2=A0 When=
 I tried to perform the routine as I had in previous months at the end of M=
ay, I ran into trouble and could tell that the outputs were not correct.=C2=
=A0 Namely, I was getting negative numbers for revenue, and therefore also =
the payout.</div><div><br>With that said, I&#39;ve been working since then =
to correct the routine.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve met with Brooke several times and sh=
e has been an immense help.=C2=A0 Unfortunately neither Mike nor Jarren are=
 familiar with this routine/report, and it will require the most work to re=
plicate on a different platform (according to what Greg told me previously)=
.=C2=A0 I was able to solve the Product Category naming issue and get thing=
s into the right funnel, and I also added a new funnel/started reporting on=
 Genetic Peak, which hadn&#39;t been incorporated=C2=A0yet.=C2=A0 However, =
the Gross Revenue for the Enrich Montezuma &amp; Enrich Info Products was c=
oming up as much lower than it was previously.</div><div><br></div><div>At =
the time, I was unsure of how to resolve this issue entirely, but Bob&#39;s=
 email gave me an idea of how to check for &quot;historical&quot; data in S=
ticky.=C2=A0 Let me explain this a little further: When the Product Categor=
y in Sticky changed, it changed for all sales, going back to 5/2020.=C2=A0 =
This seems obvious and makes sense, but=C2=A0when I wanted to see if there =
were any products in what was formerly Product Category &quot;Male Enhancem=
ent - SNM - SMC&quot;, I can&#39;t tell, as those have all changed to their=
 new &quot;SNM-Enrich&quot; names.=C2=A0 By manually looking through old ex=
ports of Sticky data from 2020 and 2021, which were sent to me by Greg when=
 I first started, I was able to see that some PIDs were miscategorized eith=
er before or after the changing of our Product Categories.<br></div><div><b=
r></div><div>For example, the reason Info Products&#39; revenue was appeari=
ng so much lower in May than it had in February, was because PID 469, &quot=
;The Pursuit Institute Rebill&quot;, had been placed in the &quot;Gotham - =
Archived&quot; category, rather than the &quot;Info Products - GDC - SMC&qu=
ot; category it needed to be in for the KNIME routine to recognize it and p=
ut it in its appropriate funnel.=C2=A0 Therefore it was being excluded from=
 the funnel and its revenue was not accounted for.=C2=A0 Now that PID469 ha=
s been added back to that category, you&#39;ll see in the attachment that t=
he monthly Gross Revenue values are back to what Bob was referencing.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0</div><div>In the opposite direction, I found that there were some pr=
oducts that were placed in the old &quot;Male Enhancement - SNM - SNMC&quot=
; category (which becomes the=C2=A0Enrich Montezuma funnel in the routine) =
that are in fact <b>not </b>Enrich products.=C2=A0 For example, there were =
times in 2020/21 that Volumizer and Testosterone Booster were in that categ=
ory erroneously.=C2=A0 Moreover, Become Supernatural (specifically PIDs 616=
 &amp; 617) were being attributed as Fran products when in fact they are no=
t.=C2=A0 Gene was able to confirm this for us today and Brooke changed all =
the products to their appropriate category so that I could rerun the routin=
e.</div><div><br></div><div>The attachment I have here is a revised monthly=
 Gross Revenue for all 4 Enrich product funnels.=C2=A0 Genetic Peak and Fla=
vo Trim were being properly accounted for already, but now Info Products ha=
s been restored to its former total with all of the products properly categ=
orized.=C2=A0 I imagine that Bob is most concerned with Info Products speci=
fically, so I&#39;m happy to say that issue has been resolved.</div><div>Mo=
ntezuma&#39;s Gross Revenue, however, is indeed slightly lower than it once=
 was calculated to be.=C2=A0 As far as I can tell with=C2=A0the data I have=
 available, what is attached should be accurate now that those miscategoriz=
ed products have been removed.=C2=A0 While I can&#39;t explain exactly how =
or why they were in the wrong place, I think these issues all just speak to=
 the inefficacy of, and potential for error with, KNIME routines.=C2=A0 [If=
 you would like me to send you the old Sticky export with the specifics of =
which PIDs were miscategorized previously as an example, I can do that.]</d=

<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">For example, sales for info product=
s in Feb 2021 were reported as $21,578 at the time and on subsequent report=
s until the recent one, which shows sales for that month of only $7,905, or=
 $13,673 less than originally and
 consistently reported.=C2=A0</li><li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">I=

 less than shown on prior reports.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">With all due respect, the pointed q=

<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">If the answer is the former, that r=
aises a lot of questions about the veracity of the cost and expense numbers=

000 is not a minor adjustment.)=C2=A0</li><li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,=

s to be fixed to get accurate sales numbers, something I hope we all agree =
is pretty fundamental to running a business.=C2=A0</li></ul>
<li style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif">And to be clear, this is not about =
