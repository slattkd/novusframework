Hey Aubrey thanks for taking the time to fill this out!

I saw you wrote:

*"Lack of guidance and clear goals. I was hired on as essentially an
assistant to an Analyst, so as previously stated, finding guidance to solve
problems or take on new tasks is difficult without a Data Analyst to turn
to. While we are getting away from KNIME, there are questions that need to
be answered and issues resolved in order for us to move forward and
understand where past reporting might have gone wrong. Currently, I don't
have anyone to turn to in that regard, which leaves me with limited options
for how to resolve these problems. I can only go by what I've been shown
and told, and what is already there for me to reference."*


Do you feel like access to Ian will help you get what you need?

Also, do you feel like reporting to me instead of Mike will help or too
early to tell?

Lastly, I will add that other than Jarren and myself and Ian and our Sticky
rep (and maybe Brooke a bit since she preorganized the product IDs in
Sticky) there is no one else to talk to here.

So if none of those people have the answer that you're looking for, you're
going to have to do the work from scratch.

So in that case, you'll probably have to use a combination of people in the
company, your own ideas and potentially an outside coach or consultant
(like Ian) to help you figure out how best to do things.

And of course, you can always run the game plan past me to see what I think
before you put it into action.

Hopefully that gives you a better lay of the land as far as whose available
to talk to and how to handle situations that come up?
