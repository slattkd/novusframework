Good morning!

I am reaching out to each of you at Brett's request, in order to better
determine what analytical reports you/your department may need that are not
currently being done, or are not being done to your satisfaction.
This list can include any report that was done previously, that you do
currently, or something entirely new that you feel is necessary.

*Please respond to this email at your earliest convenience with any
reporting needs you see for your department.*  In doing so, please answer
the following questions (for each reporting need, if multiple):
1. What is the goal of this report?
2. What will be the frequency of this report? (e.g. daily, monthly,
quarterly)
3. Why is this report critical?
4. If you have multiple requests, please indicate which report is of the
highest priority and why.
5. Is this report being done by your or your team but takes up a lot of
time, or could be done better using automation?

I look forward to hearing from y'all soon!  If you have any questions
please feel free to reach out via email or on Slack.

Best,
--
