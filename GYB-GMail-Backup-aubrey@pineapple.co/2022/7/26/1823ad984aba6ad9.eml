Hi Aubrey!

My idea was actually on my Q3 goals list of things I wanted to begin
implementing that I sent to Brooke! I'll add her to this email so she
doesn't have to repeat what I say haha. Brooke, if there is anything you
want to add or change, of course let me know because we didn't get to speak
in depth about this, but this is the general breakdown in my head!

*An In-Depth Monthly Inventory Report (Including Amazon Sales). *What I aim
to do with this report is not only show the numbers we already look at and
how much of the product has gone out, but also how those numbers have
fluctuated throughout the month. I will do this by having multiple
"check-in" days, where those numbers will be logged each month. For
example, the 1st, 15th, and 30th. I think this would be extremely
beneficial to other departments as it will keep them in the loop of what is
having an effect on sales. If the Sales Department implements a new
discount, or if we add a new grouped sale on Amazon, we will be able to see
what is truly working for us!

1. The goal of this report would be to show much more than just our
inventory status, sales velocity, and days to zero as this is currently all
we are looking at.
2. This report would be a monthly report, preferably the 1st of each month,
and dispersed to all departments.
3. This report is critical because it allows multiple departments to get a
better understanding of what might be having a negative or positive impact
on the sales of a particular product!
4. N/A
5. This report would be done by me solely. As I update our Master Inventory
Report, I would also be updating the Monthly Inventory Report, so it would
not be time consuming at all!

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else from me!
