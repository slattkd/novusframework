Brett,

That all makes sense!  I'd be happy to talk to Ian if that can be arranged.

I'll continue to help Jarren get what he needs so that he can get all these
reports in place in Tableau and we can take the next steps.  I'll also fix
up the Data Analytics Reporting spreadsheet so that I can start adding new
reports that you or other departments may request from Data going forward.

Thanks!
Aubrey
