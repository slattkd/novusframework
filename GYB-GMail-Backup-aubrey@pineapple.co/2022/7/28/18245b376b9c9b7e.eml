ny and help us navigate the economic downturn, I&#39;d like to find a way t=
o evaluate where the company is at on the 1st of the month and the 15th.<di=
v><br></div><div><b>The issue is:=C2=A0</b>the finance department does some=
thing called a &quot;close&quot; in which they need about two weeks to get =
all the financial data in order and ensure its accurate before presenting i=
t to me.</div><div><br></div><div>And so the data I&#39;m getting is DANGER=
OUSLY delayed.</div><div><br></div><div>Solutions:</div><div><br></div><div=
>1) So obviously you can keep getting me the sales per month on the first o=
f every month. But I&#39;d also recommend you get me that data on the 15th =
as well.<br></div><div><br></div><div>2) The data will be more useful if we=
 can get as many of our expenses into those reports as soon as possible.=C2=
=A0</div><div>- We can get refunds, chargebacks from Sticky</div><div>- We =
can get acquisition costs from the advertising platforms</div><div>- Employ=
ee expenses should be fairly predictable and repetitive (can get data from =
finance)</div><div>- The rest of the expenses are paid every Monday, so fin=
ance should be able to provide that</div><div>- The last thing is credit ca=
rds, if we pay those 2x weekly, then you should be able to get the totals o=
f those payments weekly</div><div>- There might be other expenses? I would =
confirm w Andrea</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly we can compare your prelim=
inary report w Andrea&#39;s &quot;close&quot; report and see how off they a=
re and why.</div><div><br></div><div>But ultimately I&#39;d want to get it =
within about 5% of difference for the preliminary.</div><div><br></div><div=
>Preliminary will be slightly less accurate and MUCH faster.</div><div><br>=
</div><div>&quot;Close&quot; report will be highly accurately, very slow.</=
div><div><br></div><div>Does this make sense?<br></div></div></div></div></=
