Hello!

Brett has requested that I give him a profit estimate for August 2022.
Would y'all be able to provide me with a rough P&L for the month?
Specifically I'm looking for the total costs for Payroll, Contractors, and
SaaS subscriptions, respectively.  Even just those expenses would be a huge
help!

Of second tier importance, I was hoping you could help me locate expenses
for our Direct Mail campaigns so I can create a report for Robert Martin.
Namely, I'm trying to find expenses from GreatFalls Marketing or Support
Services Group, North American Media, and JJS&A.  Can you tell me whether I
can find them in the P&L, and how they are coded?

Thanks so much in advance! I hope you all are looking forward to a great
weekend!
