Hi Shawna,

Hope you had a nice weekend!  I wanted to let you know that the Copy
Writer's Report for August is all up-to-date and ready to go.

The last few rows on the Project Stats page has 4 projects for Maria with
no Assigned Date, so that's throwing off some of the graphs a little, but
otherwise everything is done.

Let me know if you have any adjustments or additions you'd like to make!
Thanks!
Aubrey
