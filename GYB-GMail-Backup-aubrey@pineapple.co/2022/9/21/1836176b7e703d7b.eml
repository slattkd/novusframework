Hi Aubrey,
We are not aware of this product "The Pursuit Institute"
Andrew did we transfer over these domains and is the product still live?

I'm not aware of how those are categorized on sales or rebills coming in.
But sounds like they were not moved over to Sticky then on our end and are
still in Pineapple's.

Kind Regards,

Did you guys have a scheduled call?<br>
I &#39;m sorry i didn&#39;t get an alert.
<div>Sabrina is sick right now if she did not tell you yet.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Looks like payment should have been $300-$400, so nothings really due,=
 but instead of waiting for those funds we are going to deduct from what PI=
neapple owes us or vice versa, so please let&#39;s do calculate August.<br =

<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Wi=
th today&#39;s call being a miss again, let&#39;s try this way: Written ins=
tructions for computing the monthly Media Reps (MR) revenue share payment t=
o Second Marsh Consulting (SMC) for the
 sale of Enrich Info Products under the arrangement recently acquired from =
Pineapple / Gotham.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e basic concept is simple: SMC receives a monthly revenue sharing payment a=
n amount equal to 41.5% of gross profit. Gross profit is gross sales less c=
ertain defined costs and expenses,
 such as chargeback costs, refunds, affiliate costs, and others.=C2=A0</div=
>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e slightly tricky part is that many of the costs related to the sales of a =
particular month are not known until sometimes months later. For example, f=
or a sale made in January, the refund
 or chargeback cost often hits the accounts in April or May, thus making th=
e determination of the monthly gross profit not possible.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">To=
 address that problem, gross profit is computed in total, since inception. =
Meaning, all sales from day one through the computation month, less all cos=
ts and expenses from day one through
 the computation month. That provides the cumulative gross profit to which =
41.5% is applied. From that amount, the cumulative revenue share payments f=
rom all prior periods is subtracted, to arrive at the current month revenue=
 share amount.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">At=
tached are two worksheets you will need. The first one is the gross sales b=
y month since inception. The second is the gross sales minus the cumulative=
 costs, as described above, to arrive
 at total gross profit, and then total prior revenue share payments made to=
 arrive at current month amount.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Mo=
st of the information -- sales and costs -- come from Sticky.IO, but some o=
f the costs come from Cake. Aubrey can help with how and where you can find=
 the elements that go into the worksheet
 if you need it.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e contract provides that you are to provide the computation for our review,=
 and payment, by the 10<span><sup>th</sup>=C2=A0of the month for the preced=
ing month. For the months of June and
 July (payments made in July and August) an estimated $4,700 was paid each =
month (based on average of prior months) since actual information for the c=
alculation was not then available.=C2=A0 It appears that those estimates we=
re high, and can be trued-up with the
 payment for the month of August, meaning reduce August payment by amount o=
f the June and July overpayments. Obviously, the August payment -- due Sept=
ember 10 -- is past due, because we have not connected and provided you thi=
s training until now. Thus, your
 speedy attention to it at this point is appreciated.=C2=A0</span></div>
