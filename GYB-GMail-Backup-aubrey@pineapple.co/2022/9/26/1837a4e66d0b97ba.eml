Subject: Re: Knime routine for Lifetime Value?

OK getting it working would be pretty helpful.

Could Greg help you with it? I assume he's busy and I don't believe he ever
used this routine.

The other option is to see if I can hire Malcolm our ex-COO to help you
with knime.

Another option, which would be slightly less useful, is for you and Jarren
to go through this routine line by line to see what it's doing and compare
it to what Jarren's code is doing.

But ultimately, if it worked... or we could get it to work for even just
one month's worth of data for one LLC like Revival Point, then we could
compare the numbers from Knime to Jarren's report, which are quite
different and figure out what the difference is.

That's the main goal.

Jarren's numbers are higher than Knime so its hard to have confidence right
now without a good explanation.
