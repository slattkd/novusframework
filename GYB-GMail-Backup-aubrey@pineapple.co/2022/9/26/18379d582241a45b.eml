Hi Brett,

There is indeed a KNIME workflow for ALTV-- it was one of the routines that
Ian just recently sent over to me; for whatever reason Greg had never sent
it to me/I'm unsure if he ever worked on it.

Because Ian's routine hasn't been used since he was at the company, it will
take work to get it updated with current values and running properly.  But,
it does exist, and Ian also provided me with a Word doc that has his
operating procedure for executing the routine.

I can start to see what I can do to get this up and running, and I will
share the routine and the doc with Jarren in case it will be helpful.

To your point, I haven't actually calculated ALTV, but obviously I'm happy
to try to help in any way I can.  At the very least, the routine should be
helpful in comparing how Ian calculated ALTV to how it is currently set up.

Thanks,
Aubrey
