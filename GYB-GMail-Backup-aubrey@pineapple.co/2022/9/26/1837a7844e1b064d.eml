Understood.

I'm not sure that Greg would be that helpful here since he didn't work on
this routine, so he'd be starting from scratch anyway.  Malcolm might know
more about this routine specifically but I can't say for sure.

What I'll do is start working on it and see if I can get it updated and
working properly.  I'll also reach out to Jarren in the meantime so he can
take a look at it as well-- maybe something will jump out at him right away
as he's going through it.

In order to update the routine I'll have to go through each node to see how
exactly it's working and to make sure that it's properly coded for new
products, categories, COGs, expenses, etc. that have changed since Ian
created the workflow.

I'll see what I can do and keep you updated with how it goes.
