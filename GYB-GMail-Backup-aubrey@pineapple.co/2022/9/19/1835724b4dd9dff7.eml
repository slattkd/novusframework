Hi everyone,

I apologize for missing the Zoom meeting last week and being away from my
email.
I am on the mend and will review this as soon as possible to get the
payment out.

Bob, I will let you know if I have any questions along the way.
Thank you!

I &#39;m sorry i didn&#39;t get an alert.
<div>Sabrina is sick right now if she did not tell you yet.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Looks like payment should have been $300-$400, so nothings really due,=
 but instead of waiting for those funds we are going to deduct from what PI=
neapple owes us or vice versa, so please let&#39;s do calculate August.<br =

<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Wi=
th today&#39;s call being a miss again, let&#39;s try this way: Written ins=
tructions for computing the monthly Media Reps (MR) revenue share payment t=
o Second Marsh Consulting (SMC) for the
 sale of Enrich Info Products under the arrangement recently acquired from =
Pineapple / Gotham.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e basic concept is simple: SMC receives a monthly revenue sharing payment a=
n amount equal to 41.5% of gross profit. Gross profit is gross sales less c=
ertain defined costs and expenses,
 such as chargeback costs, refunds, affiliate costs, and others.=C2=A0</div=
>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e slightly tricky part is that many of the costs related to the sales of a =
particular month are not known until sometimes months later. For example, f=
or a sale made in January, the refund
 or chargeback cost often hits the accounts in April or May, thus making th=
e determination of the monthly gross profit not possible.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">To=
 address that problem, gross profit is computed in total, since inception. =
Meaning, all sales from day one through the computation month, less all cos=
ts and expenses from day one through
 the computation month. That provides the cumulative gross profit to which =
41.5% is applied. From that amount, the cumulative revenue share payments f=
rom all prior periods is subtracted, to arrive at the current month revenue=
 share amount.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">At=
tached are two worksheets you will need. The first one is the gross sales b=
y month since inception. The second is the gross sales minus the cumulative=
 costs, as described above, to arrive
 at total gross profit, and then total prior revenue share payments made to=
 arrive at current month amount.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Mo=
st of the information -- sales and costs -- come from Sticky.IO, but some o=
f the costs come from Cake. Aubrey can help with how and where you can find=
 the elements that go into the worksheet
 if you need it.=C2=A0</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)"><b=
r>
</div>
<div style=3D"font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;color:rgb(0,0,0)">Th=
e contract provides that you are to provide the computation for our review,=
 and payment, by the 10<span><sup>th</sup>=C2=A0of the month for the preced=
ing month. For the months of June and
 July (payments made in July and August) an estimated $4,700 was paid each =
month (based on average of prior months) since actual information for the c=
alculation was not then available.=C2=A0 It appears that those estimates we=
re high, and can be trued-up with the
 payment for the month of August, meaning reduce August payment by amount o=
f the June and July overpayments. Obviously, the August payment -- due Sept=
ember 10 -- is past due, because we have not connected and provided you thi=
s training until now. Thus, your
 speedy attention to it at this point is appreciated.=C2=A0</span></div>
