Yeah you mentioned Ian would be less available but he told me he would not
be able to meet at all for many future months and would be totally
unavailable. Not sure if he communicated the same to you. He took about 3
weeks to respond to an email I sent asking about status of working with you
just fyi.

Regarding Tableau, I don=E2=80=99t agree. One thing that has been quite eye=
 opening
about working with Jarren is how long it takes to build everything. He came
back to me to apologize and said he should have quoted me 6 months to
complete his 90 day plan.

Also Ironside recommended building initial reports in Google Sheets or
Knime and then moving it to Tableau if we think it=E2=80=99s worth it.

Tableau appears to only be better for certain things.

Most of these reports we=E2=80=99ve discussed can be created much faster us=
ing
Knime and I=E2=80=99m not sure it=E2=80=99s worth you learning tableau unle=
ss it=E2=80=99s to help
translate what you=E2=80=99re doing to Jarren or to double check his work.
