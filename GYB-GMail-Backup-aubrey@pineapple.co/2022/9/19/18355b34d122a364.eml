Hi Brett,

The majority of the KNIME routines (the ones I use with the most
regularity) take about 15 minutes or less for me to get exports for and run
to their completion.  The Enrich Profit routine is the only workflow that
takes hours, and that is one that I only run once a month.  For this reason
I don't really see the benefit in getting a second computer, unless the
intention was to create more/more complicated KNIME routines going forward.
Ian and I have met 3 times since you suggested we meet to discuss specific
questions I had about the existing KNIME routines and other reports he used
to do that I had not been trained on.  I thought I mentioned last time you
and I spoke that Ian & his partner were about to have a baby and that he
would be less available to meet/help, but I apologize if I am mistaken and
did not share that.  He did say I could always reach out with questions,
though it may take longer for him to respond.

I'm happy to look into these things as I agree that it is always good to be
learning and improving, but I guess I'm just a bit confused based on our
last conversation about this.  I thought that the consensus was that we *should
not* spend more time training in KNIME because I understood that these
workflows would be going away once Jarren makes more progress in Tableau.
It was my understanding that Jarren had suggested I eventually get some
basic training in Tableau, since they do the same things and Tableau is
simpler and more user-friendly than KNIME.  That way I would be capable of
creating new workflows and reports in Tableau in the future.

However, based on your suggestions it sounds like I misunderstood the
conversation.  I thought I was meeting with Ian for clarity on questions I
have, not to start training in KNIME from the ground up.

Please let me know the direction you'd like me to take and I'll follow up
accordingly.
Thanks,
Aubrey
