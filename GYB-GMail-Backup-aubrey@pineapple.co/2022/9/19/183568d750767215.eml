Got it.  Ian certainly didn't make it sound like he'd be quite that
unavailable, but I obviously shouldn't count on him to be able to answer
quickly or be able to meet going forward.

I apologize for misunderstanding the goals regarding KNIME.

Ideally I'd like to start with the basics if the plan is for me to be able
to build routines from scratch and to understand all the ins and outs of
KNIME fully.  Because it seemed like the plan was to get away from KNIME,
Greg taught me how to run the routines and keep things updated from what
Ian created, so I think it would be helpful for me to have a better
groundwork understanding of the program.
KNIME has free courses of various difficulty/depth that I found here:
https://www.knime.com/knime-self-paced-courses
The good news is that they are free-- it looks like each course is 8
hours.

If you're okay with that, my plan will be to keep up with my normal
reports, but spend a lot of my time in these courses in the coming weeks.
I feel like then I will have more specific questions outlined for someone
like a Consultant.

Let me know your thoughts.
