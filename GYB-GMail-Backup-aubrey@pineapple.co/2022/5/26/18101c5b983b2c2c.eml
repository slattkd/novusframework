Good afternoon, Robert!

Andrea forwarded me your email regarding ReNae Nieman and adding her to our
Sales team reporting for commissions.  I will be able to add ReNae to the
Phone Sales Commission workflow, but I'll need a little more information
before I can do so.

When you have a moment, could you answer the following questions for me:

1. What should ReNae's Front End Commission percentage be? I would guess 7%
based on the other agents but want to be sure.

2. Will ReNae be getting paid weekly or bi-weekly?  It doesn't really
matter for the reporting itself, but I will relay this to Accounting so
ReNae is paid accordingly.

3. It appears as though AFFID 2190 is currently named "ads Nitric Facebook
#1 - 1157609631369962", but it looks like it has never been used in that
capacity.  I see that there are a couple sales starting on 5/20/22.  I just
want to confirm that those sales are ReNae before I make any changes in
Cake to reflect that.

Thanks in advance!
