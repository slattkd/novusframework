Ok, figured it out!  It looks like the spreadsheet was mistakenly set up to
subtract Day 0 Net Expenses *from *Day 0 Profit to calculate Acquisition
cost, when in reality it should be the other way around.

It may take just a little bit for me to make all the changes as it affects
a number of rows, but I'm going to start making the necessary adjustments
in the "by Dept." sheets and I will ping you when I'm finished.
