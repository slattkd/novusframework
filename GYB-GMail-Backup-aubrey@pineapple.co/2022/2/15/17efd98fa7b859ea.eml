Aubrey:

Here is my priority list for today. It will be a difficult day getting a
ton of time together, because I have a dentist appointment.

However, I think there is useful time with some discussion in advance for
the time I am not online with you.

I have modified the Google Doc: Dailies - Check Orders to review for
Refunding_

located at this link:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHp9qvXxO0McoeU1V9tfx5bPQuBm6geL/edit#

I have shared that document and several others with you. This document will
be the first priority, and the new section is the Export Data To Review
section.

The Refund Review needs to be done for the following days, one at a time.
2/11/2022
2/12
2/13
2/14

After this, I'd like you to review the rest of the Documents in SOPs (Daily
SOPs), and try to walk through them. The data should already be there for
the dates above, so there is nothing to do for you except the refund part,
but I want to see if you can go through some to see if you would have found
the same results, and develop any questions.

This will be part of our overall procedures, though we will advance the
automation and approach to this review shortly.

I also want to do a broad overview and explain where this fits in to data
analytics as a whole and the department goals as a whole. I don't know if
that will happen today, but if not Monday.

Thanks,
Greg
